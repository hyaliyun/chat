Could you also provide examples of how to use each?","solution":"# Explanation of the differences between a generator and a decorator # Generators and decorators are two different features in Python: # 1. Generators: # - Generators are used to create iterators, but with a different approach. # - They allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. # - They are defined using the 'def' keyword and contain one or more 'yield' statements. # - When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution of the function. When the 'next()' method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches the 'yield' statement. # - As opposed to a return statement, the 'yield' statement returns a value and pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls. # Example of a generator: def count_up_to(max_value): count = 1 while count <= max_value: yield count count += 1 # 2. Decorators: # - Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of a function or class method. # - Decorators allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. # - They are defined using the '@' symbol followed by the decorator function name. # - A decorator is a function that takes another function (or method) as an argument and extends or alters its behavior. # Example of a decorator: def my_decorator(func): def wrapper(): print(\\"Something is happening before the function is called.\\") func() print(\\"Something is happening after the function is called.\\") return wrapper @my_decorator def say_hello(): print(\\"Hello!\\")"},{"question":"Write a Python function that accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each integer is uniquely identifiable.
