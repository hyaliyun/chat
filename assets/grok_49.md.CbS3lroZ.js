Args: filename: The file path to load the pickled object from. Returns: The unpickled object. with open(filename, 'rb') as file: return pickle.load(file) # Detailed explanation: The \`pickle\` module in Python is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. Serialization (or pickling) is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream, and deserialization (or unpickling) is the inverse process of creating a Python object from a byte stream. Advantages: 1. Easy to use: The \`pickle\` module provides a simple API for serialization and deserialization. 2. Works with most built-in Python data types: \`pickle\` can handle complex data types including nested collections, custom objects, and more. 3. Efficient: The serialized format is binary and can be efficiently written to and read from files. Disadvantages: 1. Security: Loading pickled data from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code. Only unpickle data you trust. 2. Compatibility: The \`pickle\` format may not be compatible across different Python versions. 3. Size: Pickle serialized objects can be larger in size compared to more compact serialization formats such as JSON. Example usage: # Example object to pickle data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'scores': [85.5, 90.0, 88.0]} # Pickle the object to a file pickle_object(data, 'data.pkl') # Unpickle the object from the file loaded_data = unpickle_object('data.pkl') # Verify the data print(loaded_data)"},{"question":"Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the shortest substring that contains all the unique characters of the input string.
