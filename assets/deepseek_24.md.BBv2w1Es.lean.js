Each plant can be represented as a rooted tree where the root represents the main stem and other vertices represent branching points. Alexander has developed a system to convert any plant into a unique sequence of integers.

For example, if the tree\'s vertices in level order traversal are [root, child1, child2, child3...] then b_0 is the number of branches of root, b_1 is the number of branches of the first child, and so on.

The objective is to combine these instructions to generate a final instruction sequence by following special rules. For each character in string x: 1. If it is a letter, alternate between uppercase and lowercase starting from the first character (e.g., if the first character of x is \'a\', change it to \'A\'; if the second is \'b\', leave it as \'b\'; and so on). 2. If it is a digit (0-9), replace it with the corresponding letter in y shifted by the digit value (e.g., if y = \'abc\' and the digit is 2, replace it with \'c\'). Wrap around if necessary, such that the index is computed modulo the length of y. After transforming string x, concatenate the resulting sequence with the reversed string y. Finally, return the length of the final instruction sequence. For example: - If x = \\"a1B3\\", and y = \\"hello\\", then: - \'a\' becomes \'A\', - \'1\' maps to \'e\' (0 + 1) in \\"hello\\" as it is \'e\', - \'B\' becomes \'B\', - \'3\' maps to \'o\' (1 + 3) in \\"hello\\" as it is \'o\', - x transforms into \\"AeBo\\". - The reverse of y \\"hello\\" is \\"olleh\\". - Hence, the final sequence is \\"AeBoolleh\\". - The length of this string is 9, which will be returned.

Generator functions are a special kind of function in Python that allow you to iterate through a sequence of values without storing them all in memory. This can be especially useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences. # Basic Generator Function A generator function is defined using the `def` keyword like a normal function, but instead of using `return` to return a value, it uses the `yield` keyword. Each time the generator\'s `__next__()` method (typically accessed by the `next()` built-in function) is called, the generator resumes where it left off and continues execution until it encounters another `yield` statement. Example: ```python def simple_generator(): yield 1 yield 2 yield 3 gen = simple_generator() print(next(gen)) # Output: 1 print(next(gen)) # Output: 2 print(next(gen)) # Output: 3 ``` # Using Generators for Large Datasets Generators can be particularly useful when dealing with large or even infinite datasets. For example, we can create a generator that yields an infinite sequence of natural numbers: ```python def infinite_sequence(): num = 0 while True: yield num num += 1 gen = infinite_sequence() for i in range(5): print(next(gen)) # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ``` # Generator Expressions Python also supports generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets. Generator expressions provide a concise way to create generators. Example: ```python gen_expr = (x * x for x in range(5)) for val in gen_expr: print(val) # Output: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 ``` Task Create a generator function `powers_of_two()` that yields the powers of two up to a given number `n` (inclusive). The function should be able to handle cases where `n` is a large number efficiently by generating values one at a time. You should also create a test function that demonstrates the generator in action by printing the first 10 powers of two and then manually iterating through the next few values. Example: ```python def test_powers_of_two(): gen = powers_of_two(20) for _ in range(10): print(next(gen)) # Output: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 for _ in range(5): print(next(gen)) # Output: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384 ``` # Requirements - Use the `yield` keyword to create the generator function. - Ensure the generator yields the correct sequence of powers of two. - Implement a test function that demonstrates the generator\'s usage.

Your task is to evaluate the performance outcomes of each farmer based on their relative harvesting rates. Each farmer competes against the others, and the outcome of their competition is determined by comparing their harvesting rates. A farmer wins a match if their harvesting rate is strictly higher than their competitor. The winner of a match scores 2 points, while the loser scores 0 points.

The system needs to ensure efficient processing of orders while confirming that the inventory levels are accurately maintained. Each store has an inventory represented as a list of integers where each integer denotes the quantity of a particular product. When an order is placed, it specifies the quantities of each product that need to be shipped from the store. The system must determine if the order can be fulfilled with the current inventory, and if it can, update the inventory accordingly. To assist the corporation, create a function that verifies whether an order can be fulfilled and updates the inventory if possible. -----Function Signature----- ```python def process_order(store_inventory: List[int], order: List[int]) -> bool: pass ``` -----Input----- The function takes two arguments: * `store_inventory` (List[int]): A list of integers where each integer represents the quantity of a specific product in the store. * `order` (List[int]): A list of integers where each integer represents the quantity of a specific product requested in the order. It is guaranteed that the store_inventory and order lists are of the same length, and both contain only non-negative integers. -----Output----- The function should return a boolean value: * Return `True` if the order can be fulfilled with the current inventory. * Return `False` otherwise. Additionally, if the order can be fulfilled, the `store_inventory` should be updated to reflect the remaining quantities after processing the order. If the order cannot be fulfilled, the `store_inventory` should remain unchanged. -----Example----- ```python store_inventory = [10, 5, 7, 3] order = [2, 5, 6, 1] print(process_order(store_inventory, order)) # Output: True print(store_inventory) # Output: [8, 0, 1, 2] ``` In this example, the order can be fulfilled with the given inventory.

The function should use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all the prime numbers up to `n`. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm works as follows: 1. Create a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n + 1` initialized to `True`. The index of the array represents the number. 2. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. 3. Starting from the first prime number (2), mark all its multiples as `False`. 4.

If the provided grid is already invalid (i.e., it violates Sudoku rules even with the empty cells), the function should return `None`. ```python # Example grid input: grid = [ [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9] ] ``` The output for the above grid should be: ```python completed_grid = [ [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2], [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8], [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7], [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3], [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1], [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6], [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4], [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5], [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9] ] ``` If the initial grid is invalid, for example: ```python invalid_grid = [ [5, 3, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9] ] ``` The output should be `None`. ```python # method invocation: sudoku = Sudoku(grid) completed_grid = sudoku.validate_and_complete() ```","solution":"class Sudoku: def __init__(self, grid): self.grid = grid def is_valid(self, row, col, num): Checks if placing num in position (row, col) is valid according to Sudoku rules. # Check row for x in range(9): if self.grid[row][x] == num: return False # Check column for x in range(9): if self.grid[x][col] == num: return False # Check 3x3 subgrid start_row, start_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3) for i in range(3): for j in range(3): if self.grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num: return False return True def solve(self): Solves the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. for row in range(9): for col in range(9): if self.grid[row][col] == 0: # Find an empty cell for num in range(1, 10): # Try all numbers from 1 to 9 if self.is_valid(row, col, num): self.grid[row][col] = num if self.solve(): return True self.grid[row][col] = 0 # Reset cell for backtracking return False # Backtrack if no number is valid return True def validate_and_complete(self): Validates the initial grid and completes it if it\'s valid.

Hence, return true. ``` For `arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `arr2 = [3, 1, 2, 4]`, and `threshold = 3`, the result should be `false`. ``` Positions of elements in `arr1`: [0, 1, 2, 3] Positions of elements in `arr2`: [2, 1, 0, 3] Sum of the squares of the positional differences: (2-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (3-3)^2 = 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 8 8 > 3: Subtle permutation condition not satisfied. Hence, return false. ``` # Input/Output - `[input]` integer array `arr1` - The first array of integers representing the initial positions. - `arr1.length >= 1` - `[input]` integer array `arr2` - The second array of integers to be compared against `arr1`. - `arr2.length >= 1` - `[input]` integer `threshold` - An integer value representing the maximum acceptable sum of squared positional differences. - `[output]` a boolean value - `true` if `arr2` is a subtle permutation of `arr1` and the sum of squared positional differences is ≤ `threshold`. - `false` otherwise.","solution":"def is_subtle_permutation(arr1, arr2, threshold): Determines if arr2 is a subtle permutation of arr1 within the given threshold.

Your task is to find the k most frequent strings in the list. If there is a tie for the kth place, return all strings with the same frequency in lexicographical order. Write a function that returns a list of the k most frequent strings, in descending order of their frequency. If multiple strings have the same frequency, they should be sorted lexicographically among themselves. Example 1: Input: strings = [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\", \\"apple\\", \\"orange\\", \\"banana\\", \\"apple\\"], k = 2 Output: [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\"] Explanation: \\"apple\\" occurs 3 times and \\"banana\\" occurs 2 times, both are the top 2 frequent strings. Example 2: Input: strings = [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\", \\"cherry\\", \\"banana\\", \\"cherry\\", \\"cherry\\"], k = 1 Output: [\\"cherry\\"] Explanation: \\"cherry\\" occurs 3 times, which is the highest frequency. Example 3: Input: strings = [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\", \\"apple\\", \\"orange\\", \\"banana\\", \\"orange\\"], k = 2 Output: [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\", \\"orange\\"] Explanation: \\"apple\\" appears twice, \\"banana\\" appears twice, and \\"orange\\" appears twice. Since k = 2, and there is a tie at the 2nd place, all of them should be returned.
