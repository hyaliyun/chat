To clarify, the sequence must start from `1` and consist of consecutive positive integers. The objective is to find the maximum possible length `L` of this sequence where the GCD of all `L` integers is greater than `1`. If there\'s no such sequence with length greater than `1`, return `0`. The function should return an integer representing the length of the longest sequence with the required property. # Input - The function takes a single integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18) which represents the upper bound on the potential length of the sequence (you don\'t need to consider sequences longer than `N`). # Output - Return an integer representing the length of the longest sequence starting from `1` such that the GCD of all the integers in this sequence is greater than `1`. # Example - For `N = 6`, the longest sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and the GCD of these numbers is `1`, so the return value should be `0`. - For `N = 4`, the longest sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]` also has a GCD of `1`, so the return value should be `0`. - For `N = 10`, the longest sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` has a GCD of `1`, so the return value should be `0`. # Constraints - Since the input number `N` can be very large, the solution should consider the efficiency of calculations to avoid timeouts. # Solution Outline To solve this problem, you can use the property of GCD and prime numbers: - The GCD of a set of numbers will be greater than `1` if and only if all numbers share at least one prime number as a factor. - Therefore, the sequence with a GCD greater than `1` must consist of multiples of a prime number. The length of the sequence is maximized starting from `1` and ending before `N`. - You\'ll need to iteratively check sequences by their prime factors and find the maximum sequence that satisfies the condition.

She has a collection of books with varying numbers of chapters, and every time she picks a book, she likes to read exactly half of the chapters from random starting points. To avoid any ambiguity, if the number of chapters is odd, she just rounds it up to the nearest integer. One day, she decides to count how many different ways she can start reading the half chapters from each book. This means if a book has n chapters, she wants to know from how many different starting chapters she can begin such that exactly half of the chapters are read (rounded up). For example, if a book has 5 chapters, she can start reading from chapters 1, 2, and 3, as starting from chapter 4 or 5 does not allow her to read half the chapters, rounded up.

Each order will be stored with a unique order ID as the key. # Methods 1. **add_order(order_id: int, customer_name: str, product_name: str)**: - Adds a new order with the given `order_id`, `customer_name`, and `product_name`. - The status of a new order should be \\"Placed\\". - If an order with the same `order_id` already exists, raise a `ValueError` with the message `\\"Order ID already exists\\"`. 2. **update_status(order_id: int, status: str)**: - Updates the status of the order with the given `order_id`. - If the status is not one of \\"Placed\\", \\"Shipped\\", \\"In Transit\\", or \\"Delivered\\", raise a `ValueError` with the message `\\"Invalid status\\"`. - If the order ID does not exist, raise a `ValueError` with the message `\\"Order ID does not exist\\"`. 3. **get_order(order_id: int) -> dict**: - Returns all information about the order with the given `order_id` as a dictionary with keys `order_id`, `customer_name`, `product_name`, and `status`. - If the order ID does not exist, raise a `ValueError` with the message `\\"Order ID does not exist\\"`. Example ```python # Initialize the tracking system tracking_system = OrderTracking() # Adding orders tracking_system.add_order(1, \\"Alice\\", \\"Laptop\\") tracking_system.add_order(2, \\"Bob\\", \\"Smartphone\\") # Updating status tracking_system.update_status(1, \\"Shipped\\") tracking_system.update_status(2, \\"In Transit\\") # Retrieving order information print(tracking_system.get_order(1)) # Output: {\'order_id\': 1, \'customer_name\': \'Alice\', \'product_name\': \'Laptop\', \'status\': \'Shipped\'} print(tracking_system.get_order(2)) # Output: {\'order_id\': 2, \'customer_name\': \'Bob\', \'product_name\': \'Smartphone\', \'status\': \'In Transit\'} # Testing error cases tracking_system.add_order(1, \\"Charlie\\", \\"Tablet\\") # Should raise ValueError: Order ID already exists tracking_system.update_status(3, \\"Delivered\\") # Should raise ValueError: Order ID does not exist tracking_system.update_status(1, \\"Cancelled\\") # Should raise ValueError: Invalid status tracking_system.get_order(3) # Should raise ValueError: Order ID does not exist ``` Your goal is to implement the `OrderTracking` class according to the above specifications.","solution":"class OrderTracking: def __init__(self): self.orders = {} def add_order(self, order_id, customer_name, product_name): if order_id in self.orders: raise ValueError(\\"Order ID already exists\\") self.orders[order_id] = { \\"order_id\\": order_id, \\"customer_name\\": customer_name, \\"product_name\\": product_name, \\"status\\": \\"Placed\\" } def update_status(self, order_id, status): if order_id not in self.orders: raise ValueError(\\"Order ID does not exist\\") if status not in [\\"Placed\\", \\"Shipped\\", \\"In Transit\\", \\"Delivered\\"]: raise ValueError(\\"Invalid status\\") self.orders[order_id][\\"status\\"] = status def get_order(self, order_id): if order_id not in self.orders: raise ValueError(\\"Order ID does not exist\\") return self.orders[order_id]"},{"question":"Marco is fascinated by mountains and wants to learn more about the elevation levels of various mountain ranges.

Every UID is a sequence of six characters, where each character is an uppercase letter (\'A\' to \'Z\') or a digit (\'0\' to \'9\'). The algorithm ensures the UID meets specific rules of uniqueness and structure to prevent duplication and ensure security.

She is in charge of optimizing their file storage system. The system stores files in a hierarchical directory structure, where each directory can contain files and other directories.

The total size of all files directly within that directory. 2. The total count of all files directly within that directory. 3. The total size of all files within that directory and all of its subdirectories (recursively). 4. The total count of all files within that directory and all of its subdirectories (recursively). Sophie has tasked you with writing a function that, given the directory structure and file sizes, returns the metadata for each directory. The directory structure will be provided as a nested dictionary, where keys are directory names and values are either dictionaries (representing subdirectories) or integers (representing file sizes). You need to write a function, `calculate_metadata`, that returns a dictionary with directory names as keys and tuples as values.

Each platter must cover a rectangle or square of size p times q with 1 leq p leq N and 1 leq q leq M, and each platter can be placed anywhere on the table as long as it completely fits within the table dimensions. Chef wants to know the total number of distinct ways he can place the platters in such a way that each size p times q is considered unique and counted separately, irrespective of where they are placed on the table.

The country consists of five districts connected via various highways. Each highway has its own toll and can generally be used multiple times in a day.

Each driver would pay the toll for crossing the highway until they hit the limit, after which the toll is no longer charged for that highway for the day. You need to find the minimum cost to travel from one district to another, taking into account the highway toll limits. **Input:** - The first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10000), the number of districts. - The second line contains an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 50000), the number of highways. - Each of the next `m` lines contains four integers `a`, `b`, `t`, and `l` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, 1 ≤ t, l ≤ 10^9) representing a highway that goes between districts `a` and `b` with a daily toll `t` across it and a daily toll limit `l`. - The following line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 1000), representing the number of queries. - Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), representing a query of the minimum cost to travel from district `u` to district `v`. **Output:** For each query, output the minimum cost to travel from district `u` to district `v`.

But since the toll for each does not exceed the limit on any link, total toll accumulated is lower. - Query 2: The minimum cost from district 2 to district 4 would simply be taking the shortest path [2-3-4] paying 10+5 = 15. - For the second example, the optimal path involves the allowable tolls directly connecting or through intermediate districts without overshooting toll limits acting as constraints.","solution":"import heapq from collections import defaultdict def minimum_travel_cost(n, highways, queries): # Construct the graph with modified weights. graph = defaultdict(list) for a, b, t, l in highways: cost = min(t, l) graph[a].append((cost, b)) graph[b].append((cost, a)) def dijkstra(start, end): pq = [(0, start)] dist = {i: float(\'inf\') for i in range(1, n + 1)} dist[start] = 0 while pq: current_cost, u = heapq.heappop(pq) if u == end: return current_cost if current_cost > dist[u]: continue for toll, v in graph[u]: next_cost = current_cost + toll if next_cost < dist[v]: dist[v] = next_cost heapq.heappush(pq, (next_cost, v)) return -1 results = [] for u, v in queries: results.append(dijkstra(u, v)) return results"},{"question":"Write a function that takes a string consisting of lowercase alphabetical characters and returns the character that appears the most often.

Function Signature: ```python def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int: ``` **Input:** - A single string `s` (0 <= len(s) <= 10^5), consisting of ASCII characters. **Output:** - Return an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. **Examples:** ```python length_of_longest_substring(\\"abcabcbb\\") ``` Output: ```python 3 ``` Explanation: The answer is \\"abc\\", with the length of 3. ```python length_of_longest_substring(\\"bbbbb\\") ``` Output: ```python 1 ``` Explanation: The answer is \\"b\\", with the length of 1. ```python length_of_longest_substring(\\"pwwkew\\") ``` Output: ```python 3 ``` Explanation: The answer is \\"wke\\", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, \\"pwke\\" is a subsequence and not a substring. ```python length_of_longest_substring(\\"\\") ``` Output: ```python 0 ``` Explanation: The answer is an empty string, with the length of 0. **Constraint:** - The input string\'s length won\'t exceed 10^5 characters. - The function should run in O(n) time complexity. **Notes:** Consider using a sliding window approach to keep track of the current substring and hash set or dictionary to monitor the unique characters within the substring.","solution":"def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int: Returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. char_index_map = {} start = 0 max_length = 0 for end in range(len(s)): if s[end] in char_index_map: start = max(start, char_index_map[s[end]] + 1) char_index_map[s[end]] = end max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1) return max_length"},{"question":"An image is represented by an m x n integer grid where each integer represents the pixel value (0 or 1). You are also given three integers sr, sc, and newColor, where sr and sc represent the row and column of the starting pixel (row-white and column-wise). Flood fill the image starting from the pixel (sr, sc) by changing all \'connected\' pixels of the same color to the newColor. Connected pixels are those that have the same color and are linked 4-directionally (up, down, left, right). Write a function to perform flood fill on the image. Example 1: Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]] sr = 1 sc = 1 newColor = 2 Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]] Explanation: From the center of the image with a start pixel at (1, 1) (i.e., the pixel with the value 1 at row 1 and column 1), all trailing pixels with the value 1 are changed to the value 2. Note it is bordering the 4-directional pixels, and hence the changed image contains the newColor value 2 in the connected components. Example 2: Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1]] sr = 1 sc = 1 newColor = 1 Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,1]] Explanation: Since the original color and newColor are the same, no changes are made to the image.

This transformation continues until the result is a palindrome (a number that reads the same backward as forward). Stan is curious about how many transformations he has to perform for various starting integers until he obtains a palindrome. Can you help him determine the number of transformations required for any starting integer n? Input Format: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer n (1 leq n leq 10^4). Output Format: For each test case, print a single integer representing the number of transformations required to obtain a palindrome starting from n.

Example 1: Input: operations = [(3, 5, \'+\'), (10, 2, \'-\'), (6, 3, \'*\'), (8, 2, \'/\')] Output: [8, 8, 18, 4.0] Explanation: 3 + 5 = 8 10 - 2 = 8 6 * 3 = 18 8 / 2 = 4.0 Example 2: Input: operations = [(15, 3, \'/\'), (7, 3, \'+\'), (12, 4, \'-\'), (0, 1, \'*\')] Output: [5.0, 10, 8, 0] Explanation: 15 / 3 = 5.0 7 + 3 = 10 12 - 4 = 8 0 * 1 = 0 Your Task: You don\'t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `perform_operations()` which takes a list of tuples (operations) as input and returns a list of results. Expected Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of operations.
