You need to help the pirates determine if a given message can be successfully transmitted under these conditions. The network of planets is given initially and can be updated dynamically with new data routes. Your task is to handle queries to check the possibility of successful message transmission and to update the network when new routes are discovered.

Each of the following m lines contains three integers x, y, and z (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, 1 ≤ z ≤ 10^9) describing that there initially exists a bidirectional data route with signal strength z between planets x and y. Then q lines follow, describing the queries. Each query can be one of the following two types: 1. + x y z (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, 1 ≤ z ≤ 10^9), meaning a data route with signal strength z appears between planets x and y; 2. ? x y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n), meaning you should determine whether a message can be successfully transmitted starting from planet x to planet y with the constraints mentioned.

Each booking code consists of uppercase English letters and digits, and has a minimum length of 5 and a maximum length of 10.

Formally: * The city is represented as a list of intersections and roads between them. * Each road has an associated travel time and a reliability score (a non-negative integer). * You need to calculate the shortest reliable path between two given intersections. A path is considered reliable if the reliability score of each road in the path is greater than or equal to a given threshold k. * If no such path exists, output -1.

The system should support the following operations: 1. **Add Product**: Add a new product to the inventory. If a product with the same ID already exists, the existing product should be updated with the new details. 2. **Delete Product**: Remove a product from the inventory based on its ID. 3. **Update Stock**: Update the stock quantity of a product. 4. **View Product**: View the details of a single product based on its ID. 5. **View All Products**: Display the details of all the products in the inventory.

The grid is represented by a W × H matrix of cells. Each cell can be a road, a building, or the destination. The robot can move from one cell to another if the target cell is a road. It cannot move onto or through buildings. The robot can also perform some optimizations: if two adjacent cells form a straight line path (either horizontally or vertically), it should group these cells into a single segment and handle it with a single move. This means that instead of processing each cell individually, it can \\"jump\\" across these segments in one move. Your task is to write a function that will find the shortest path for the robot from its initial position to the destination, utilizing these segment jumps. Note that the robot can only move in four main directions (north, south, east, or west). Input The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format: > W H > Grid1 > Grid2 > ... > GridH The first line gives two positive integers W, H (1 ≤ W, H ≤ 50) separated by a single space. After that, information on the grid is given over H lines. Each line represents a row of the grid and is a string of length W, where each character corresponds to a cell in the grid: * `.`: Road cell (can move through) * `#`: Building cell (cannot move through) * `D`: Destination * `R`: Initial position of the robot The grid always contains exactly one initial position and one destination.

There are n treasure chests scattered throughout the forest on a 2D grid. Each chest has a certain amount of gold coins. You need to determine the maximum amount of gold coins you can collect by visiting up to k distinct chests. However, you can only move horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells. You start at the position (0, 0) and each movement (up, down, left, or right) takes 1 unit of time. Consider the positions to be 1-indexed. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 50). The following n lines contain three integers each: x_i, y_i, and g_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50, 0 ≤ g_i ≤ 10^6) — the position and the amount of gold in the i-th chest.

In the second test case: * You can start at (0, 0) and visit up to 3 chests; (1, 1) with 50 gold, (2, 2) with 100 gold, and (3, 3) with 200 gold for a total of 350 gold. * You can alternatively visit (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) for 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 gold. * The optimal selection here is visiting (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) yielding a total of 600, matching the best possible collection.","solution":"def max_gold_collected(t, test_cases): Function to determine the maximum amount of gold coins that can be collected by visiting up to k distinct chests. results = [] for case in test_cases: n, k = case[0] chests = case[1] chests.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True) results.append(sum(chest[2] for chest in chests[:k])) return results"},{"question":"Given a grid of size `n x m` filled with integers, you are tasked with finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-grid.

When the cooling unit is operating, it reduces the temperature by a fixed amount every second. Write a function `control_temperature(records, threshold, reduction)` that takes a list of integers `records`, an integer `threshold` and an integer `reduction`. The function should return a list of integers which represents the updated temperature records after operating the cooling unit accordingly.

For example, if the initial recorded temperatures are `[28, 32, 35, 30, 33, 34, 29]`, the threshold is `30`, and the reduction value is `3`, the cooling unit should operate only for the second and third entries because they exceed the threshold.

Your goal is to schedule all the delivery orders in a way that minimizes the maximum lateness. Write a program that takes the number of orders and their deadlines and durations, and produces the schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness.

Output: Output a single integer, which is the minimum possible maximum lateness with the optimal schedule.

During the spring, all the leaves that are green (value 1) turn yellow. During the autumn, all the leaves that are yellow (value 2) turn red.

The sales data may not be in chronological order and some dates may have no sales at all, resulting in missing days in the records. James decided to write a function to calculate the 7-day moving average of sales amounts. However, since some dates might be missing, the function should consider the previous 7 recorded sales, not specifically the last 7 chronological days. If there are fewer than 7 previous sales records available at any point, James wants the function to calculate the average of however many records are available. Write a function `moving_average(sales_data: List[Tuple[str, int]]) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]` that takes a list of sales records, where each record is a tuple of a string representing the date in \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\" format and an integer representing the sales amount on that date. The function should return a list of tuples, each containing a date and the corresponding 7-day moving average of sales amounts calculated as described.

There is only one possible badge importance level: either \'L\' (low) or \'H\' (high). Mia wants to distribute the badges so that each participant with a \'H\' badge importance level gets the highest skill level available among participants with \'L\' badge importance level. She can perform the following operation any number of times: * Select any two participants i and j such that b_i = \'H\' and b_j = \'L\' and swap their badges. Determine if it\'s possible to distribute the badges under the given constraints or not. **Input** The first line contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500) — the number of participants.

Each team is designated by a unique integer ID between 1 and N. To balance the workload, TechNova decided to implement a system where the sum of team IDs assigned to each employee must be unique. Here\'s how it works: For every employee, they are assigned a subset of team IDs such that the sum of the team IDs in that subset is a unique value not assigned to any other employee. Each team ID can only be assigned to one employee.
