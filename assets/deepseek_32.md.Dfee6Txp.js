Each year in Arithmia consists of m months, and each month has exactly k days. The residents of Arithmia also use a different way to mark the passage of weeks. For them, a week is defined as any consecutive group of d days. The King of Arithmia wishes to design a schedule such that no weeks (as defined by the residents) overlap more than once. In this context, a week \'overlaps\' if there are common days among different weeks. A non-overlapping week should follow these conditions: 1. Each day belongs to exactly one week. 2. The last day of a month, when combined with the first day(s) of the next month, does not form an overlapping week.

Given this feature, we can create a new data structure, called an \\"indexable array,\\" which is a list of integers where the value of each integer can be used as an index to get its next value. You are provided with an integer array and your task is to simulate the process of using the values as indices to refer to the next values. Specifically, given a starting index, you need to output the value found after following a sequence of indices starting from the given starting index up to a specified length. Write a function called `indexable_array` which takes in three parameters: 1. an integer array `arr` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), 2. an integer `start` (0 ≤ start < n) indicating the initial index to start the sequence, and 3. an integer `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 10000) indicating the number of steps to follow in the sequence. The function should return the value found after following the sequence for the specified length of steps. If at any step an index is out of bounds, return -1 immediately. # Input: The first line contains one integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the array. The second line contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array.

The city junctions and streets are represented as a directed graph with n nodes (numbered from 1 to n) and n-1 edges. The central junction with index 1 is the only one having exactly one outgoing street to another junction.

The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to N, with the root node having a number 1. Each network node can either be operational or faulty, and the goal is to determine the minimum time required to inspect the entire network and identify the faulty nodes. Every node can be inspected in one unit of time, and the inspection of nodes can happen in parallel as long as the paths do not overlap. To perform inspections efficiently, the company wants to break the network into clusters such that each cluster will be inspected sequentially in a non-overlapping manner. Write a function to determine the minimum time required to inspect all nodes in the company’s network.

The i-th character represents the status of node i+1: \'O\' denotes an operational node while \'F\' denotes a faulty node.

Alex performs the following operation on the string: he finds the longest substring where all characters are the same and replaces it with a single instance of that character.

In the first operation, Alex replaces \\"aaaa\\" with \\"a\\", so the string becomes \\"abbbccccd\\". 2.

Finally, Alex needs three more operations to reduce the string one character at a time: \\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"c\\", and \\"d\\". In the second example, the initial string is \\"ab\\". Since all substrings are already of length one, Alex needs `n - 1` operations, or one operation to reduce the string to a single character. In the third example, the initial string is \\"zzzz\\". This is already the longest possible single substring so it only requires one operation to reduce it to a single character. In the fourth example, the initial string is \\"xyzxyz\\".

Alice and Bob take turns altering substrings of the string, starting with Alice. In each move, a player must select any substring of length k (1 leq k leq n) such that all characters within this substring are the same, and change all the characters within this substring to the opposite character (\'0\' becomes \'1\' and \'1\' becomes \'0\'). The game ends when no such substring can be found. The objective of both players is different: Alice aims to maximize the number of \'0\'s in the final string, while Bob aims to maximize the number of \'1\'s in the final string. Both players play optimally, and therefore, always make the best possible move for their objective. Homer is curious about what the final string will look like after both players have played optimally. Therefore, you need to determine the final state of the binary string for each given test case. Each test case consists of a single integer t (1 le t le 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single binary string s (1 leq |s| leq 50) made up of \'0\'s and \'1\'s.

For convenience, the tree is described using a list where each element represents a node\'s value. The root is the first element, and all subsequent elements correspond to nodes level by level. If the node at the current index `i` has children, its left child will be at index `2*i + 1` and its right child at index `2*i + 2`. Alice and Bob take turns to play, with Alice always going first. During Alice\'s turn, she selects any **leaf** node of the tree and removes it. During Bob\'s turn, he removes any node that is not the root (i.e., a node that has at least one parent but not necessarily leaf). The game continues until a player cannot make a move. The player who cannot make a move loses. Given the structure of the binary tree, determine which player will win if both play optimally.

The length of each string is between 1 and 100. For each test case, print a single integer - the maximum possible value of any digit after performing any number of operations. # Example Input ``` 3 123 2759 999999 ``` Output ``` 6 8 9 ``` Explanation In the first test case, you can replace `1` and `2` with `3` (mod 10) resulting in `33`. Then, replace two `3`s with `6` (mod 10). Therefore, the maximum digit is `6`. In the second test case, you can replace `2` and `7` with `9` (mod 10), resulting in `959`. Then, replace `9` and `5` with `4` (mod 10) and now `49`. Finally replace `4` and `9` with `3` (mod 10) and maximize `9` with no need for further replacement. In the third test case, any replacement will result in a `9` as `9+9 = 18 (mod 10) = 8` and thus the maximum digit is `9`. So there\'s no need for further operations as all are already maximized.","solution":"def max_digit_after_operations(t, test_cases): Determines the maximum possible value of any digit after performing any number of allowed operations on the given string of digits.

The description of the test cases follows: For each test case: - The first line contains two integers n and k (2 leq n leq 100, 0 leq k leq 10^5) – the length of the array and the number of operations to perform. - The second line contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n} (1 leq a_{i} leq 10^9) – the initial contents of the array. Output the maximum possible value of the smallest element in the array after performing exactly k operations for each test case. # Example ``` Input 2 3 2 2 6 8 4 5 5 15 25 10 Output 4 5 ``` # Explanation In the first test case, you can perform the following operations to maximize the minimum number: - Pick 2 and 6 to replace 6 with gcd(2, 6) = 2, so the array becomes [2, 2, 8]. - Pick 2 and 8 to replace 8 with gcd(2, 8) = 2, so the final array is [2, 2, 2]. Hence, the minimum number in the array is 2. In the second test case, you can perform operations to maximize the minimum number: - Pick 5 and 15 to replace 15 with gcd(5, 15) = 5, so the array becomes [5, 5, 25, 10]. - Pick 5 and 25 to replace 25 with gcd(5, 25) = 5, so the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 10]. - Pick 5 and 10 to replace 10 with gcd(5, 10) = 5, so the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5].

Each signal is a noisy version of a known pattern. The patterns are generated by repeating a specific sub-pattern, but the Daleks have added small random deviations to make decoding harder. There are m patterns, each with a sub-pattern of length l. The task is to identify the original sub-pattern from the noisy sequence. Each pattern is repeated consecutively to form a sequence of length n (n = k times l), where k is the number of repetitions of the sub-pattern.

Ujan wants to determine how many distinct substrings of length m are common to both strings. A substring of a string is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. For example, the substrings of length 2 of the string \\"abc\\" are \\"ab\\" and \\"bc\\". Your task is to help Ujan by writing a program that finds the number of distinct substrings of length m that appear in both strings. The first line contains a single integer k (1 leq k leq 100), the number of test cases. For each of the test cases, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 leq m leq n leq 100), the length of the strings and the length of the substrings to consider, respectively.

Participants from various cities (numbered from 1 to n) must travel to Logopolis (city 0), which is the capital, for the main event. The tournament lasts for k days, and all participants must be present in the city for the entire duration of the event. The country’s transportation system is well-documented, and all travel options are characterized by bus routes that either start from Logopolis or terminate at Logopolis. Given that there\'s no overnight travel, each bus route operates by departing from one city and arriving at another on the same day. Participants cannot engage in tournament activities on the days they travel. Each bus route is defined by four variables: departure day, departure city, arrival city, and cost. No two cities have multiple bus routes between them on the same day. The cost is the fare for that particular route. Your task is to find the minimum possible travel cost required to gather all participants in Logopolis for k consecutive days and return them to their respective home cities afterward. Some participants may choose to stay longer than the k days if it minimizes the overall cost. The cost must be determined based on the given bus route options, and you need to ensure all participants can attend the event and return home efficiently. The first line of input contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6).

The input format is as follows: - The first line contains two integers, N and Q (1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 100,000), representing the number of vertices and the number of queries, respectively. - The second line contains N integers, value[i] (1 ≤ value[i] ≤ 10^9), describing the initial values of the vertices. - The next N-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N), representing an edge between u and v. - The following Q lines describe the queries in the following format: - \\"1 v x\\" for an update operation where v is the vertex to update and x is the new value. - \\"2 v\\" for a sum operation where v is the vertex for which you need to find the sum of values in its subtree.

To achieve this, you can use any algorithm of your choice, but you must implement the sorting logic yourself. Your solution should efficiently handle large datasets, meaning you should strive for an algorithmic complexity that performs well on large inputs.

The cells directly connected to a given cell include the cell itself, and cells that share at least one common edge with it.
