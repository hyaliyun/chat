Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function requirements: - The function should initialize an empty list to store the cumulative averages. - As it iterates through the input list of numbers, it should maintain a running sum and a count of the numbers processed so far. - For each number in the input list, the function should compute the average by dividing the running sum by the count, then append this average to the cumulative average list. - Finally, the function should return the list of cumulative averages. Example: ```python input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4] output_list = cumulative_average(input_list) print(output_list) # Output should be [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5] ``` In this example, the cumulative averages are computed as follows: 1. Average of the first element: (1) / 1 = 1.0 2. Average of the first two elements: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5 3. Average of the first three elements: (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.0 4. Average of all four elements: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5","solution":"def cumulative_average(numbers): Computes the cumulative average of a list of numbers.

Here are the detailed steps the function should perform: 1. Open a specified text file in read mode. 2. Extract all words in the text file. Words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters separated by non-alphabetic characters. 3. Identify words that exceed a specified length. 4. Write these long words to a new text file, ensuring each word appears only once in the output file. You need to use the `os` and `re` packages to accomplish this task. The function signature should be: ```python def find_long_words(input_file: str, output_file: str, length: int) -> None: pass ``` **Input:** - `input_file` (str): The path to the input text file. - `output_file` (str): The path to the output text file where the filtered words will be written. - `length` (int): The minimum length of words to be included in the output file. **Assumptions:** - The input file path and file are always valid. - Words are case-insensitive (e.g., \'Word\' and \'word\' are considered the same and should appear only once in the output). - The output file should contain one word per line. - Punctuation and other non-alphabetic characters separate words.

If a thread tries to increment the counter beyond its limit, it should be blocked until other threads decrement the counter. Here\'s a detailed breakdown of the requirements: 1. Your `LimitedCounter` class should accept two parameters: `initial` (the initial value of the counter) and `limit` (the maximum value the counter can reach). 2. The class should have an `increment` method that: - Increments the counter by 1 only if it does not exceed the limit. - If the counter would exceed the limit, the thread should wait until the counter is decremented by another thread. 3. The class should have a `decrement` method that: - Decrements the counter by 1. - Notifies any waiting threads that they can attempt to increment the counter. 4. Use a `threading.Condition` object to manage the synchronization between threads. Your task is to implement the `LimitedCounter` class and its methods. Here\'s a template to get you started: ```python import threading class LimitedCounter: def __init__(self, initial, limit): self.counter = initial self.limit = limit self.condition = threading.Condition() def increment(self): with self.condition: while self.counter >= self.limit: self.condition.wait() self.counter += 1 self.condition.notify_all() def decrement(self): with self.condition: self.counter -= 1 self.condition.notify_all() ``` **Note:** You do not need to write any additional code to create or manage threads. This class should be thread-safe and handle concurrent access correctly.","solution":"import threading class LimitedCounter: def __init__(self, initial, limit): self.counter = initial self.limit = limit self.condition = threading.Condition() def increment(self): with self.condition: while self.counter >= self.limit: self.condition.wait() self.counter += 1 self.condition.notify_all() def decrement(self): with self.condition: self.counter -= 1 self.condition.notify_all()"},{"question":"You are asked to implement a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.

The function should take a single positive integer input greater than 1 and return a list of prime factors.

Here\'s the specific context for your implementation: 1. **Input Parameters**: - `X` : A numpy array of shape `[N, d]` representing the dataset with `N` samples, each having `d` dimensions. - `k` : An integer representing the number of nearest neighbors to find for each sample. 2. **Output**: - A numpy array of shape `[N, k]` containing the indices of the `k` nearest neighbors for each sample in the dataset. # Function Signature: ```python import numpy as np from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist def FindNearestNeighbors(X, k): pass ``` # Implementation Details: - Use `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` to compute the pairwise distances between samples in the dataset. - Ensure to handle self-distance properly, so that a sample is not considered its own neighbor. - Use numpy\'s functions to efficiently extract the indices of the nearest neighbors. # Example: ```python import numpy as np X = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.], [5., 6.], [7., 8.]], dtype=float) k = 2 neighbors = FindNearestNeighbors(X, k) print(neighbors) ``` # Constraints: - The dataset should have at least 2 samples and the dimensionality should be at least 1. - The value of `k` should be less than `N`.

You can assume that the folder and files are readable and exist. 2. Assume all files are not too large to be handled in memory. 3. The `group_id` and `score` are always valid and contain no NaN values. **Hint:** Use the `pandas` library for reading and processing the CSV files, and the `os` module for listing files.","solution":"import os import pandas as pd def calculate_group_averages(folder: str): Calculate and print the average score for each student group from multiple CSV files in the given folder.
