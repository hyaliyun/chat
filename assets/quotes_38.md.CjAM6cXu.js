He is currently working on a project that involves analyzing the performance metrics of these services. One of the key metrics he needs to calculate is the average response time. To do this efficiently, he needs to process the performance metrics received in real-time and should be able to provide the average response time at any given moment. Each metric is represented as a tuple (t, r), where t is the timestamp (in seconds) when the metric was recorded, and r is the response time (in milliseconds). Metrics are received in chronological order. Ram wants to ensure that he can compute the average response time in constant time complexity. Design a function that can process incoming metrics and compute the average response time efficiently. Implement the following functions: 1. `add_metric(t, r)`: This function takes a timestamp `t` and response time `r` and adds the metric to the internal data structure. 2. `get_average()`: This function returns the average response time of the metrics that have been added so far. Input There are multiple lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), representing the type of the operation: - If `q` is 1, it is followed by two integers `t` and `r` where `t` is the timestamp and `r` is the response time. - If `q` is 2, it represents a request to get the average response time.

The concept revolves around finding the median of a list. This is an interactive problem. You are given a list of n integers. Your task is to determine the median of this list. The median of a list of odd length is the middle element when sorted, and for even length, it is the average of the two middle elements when sorted. You don\'t have direct access to the list, but you can query your friend by giving an index, and he will tell you the value at that index. Here is the format your queries can take: 1. Query the value at index i: In a separate line, output `? i` Your friend will respond with the integer at index i. To determine the median, you can use up to 10 * n queries. Note: n will always be odd (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Once you have found the median, print it in the following format: `! median` Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n is odd). The next n lines contain the elements of the list in an unknown order. Each line contains an integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). Interaction You begin the interaction by reading n. To ask for the value at index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), output `? i`. Your friend will respond with the value at that index. Once you determine the median, output `! median`. Examples Input ``` 5 --indexing is not explicitly provided in input, as you have to ask your friend for that information-- ``` Output ``` ? 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 ! median_value ``` Explanation To find the median correctly, you need to determine the values at specific indices by querying your friend the value at each index. For instance, if the list contains the values `[3, 2, 5, 1, 4]`, the median of this sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`. You have to determine by querying the appropriate number of indices and then figuring out the median value. **Implementation Notes:** - Since the problem ensures n will always be odd, the median is always a single element. - Remember to utilize the allowed queries efficiently to determine the median. - Output format should closely follow the specified format, paying attention to flush after each query.

You are given a city represented as an undirected graph with n intersections and m proposed roads. Each road connects two intersections and has a certain cost associated with building it. The task is to determine the minimal total construction cost to connect all the intersections so that there is a path between any two intersections. Write a function that takes the number of intersections, the number of proposed roads, and the list of proposed roads with their costs as input. The function should output the minimal total construction cost to achieve the connectivity requirement. Input - The first line consists of two integers, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of intersections, and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) — the number of proposed roads. - The next m lines each contain three integers, u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; u ≠ v; 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000000), where u and v denote the intersections that the proposed road connects, and w is the cost of building this road. Output - Output a single integer, the minimal total construction cost to connect all the intersections. Examples Input 4 5 1 2 1 1 3 4 2 3 6 2 4 5 3 4 3 Output 8 Input 3 3 1 2 2 1 3 3 2 3 1 Output 3 Note In the first example, the minimum cost to connect all intersections is achieved by constructing the roads with costs 1 (connecting intersections 1 and 2), 4 (connecting intersections 1 and 3), and 3 (connecting intersections 3 and 4). Therefore, the total cost is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8. In the second example, the minimum cost to connect all intersections is achieved by constructing the roads with costs 2 (connecting intersections 1 and 2), 1 (connecting intersections 2 and 3). Therefore, the total cost is 2 + 1 = 3. Hint To solve this problem efficiently, you might consider using algorithms such as Kruskal\'s or Prim\'s to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. The MST will give you the minimal total construction cost to ensure there is a path between any two intersections.","solution":"def find(parent, i): if parent[i] == i: return i return find(parent, parent[i]) def union(parent, rank, x, y): root_x = find(parent, x) root_y = find(parent, y) if root_x != root_y: if rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]: parent[root_y] = root_x elif rank[root_x] < rank[root_y]: parent[root_x] = root_y else: parent[root_y] = root_x rank[root_x] += 1 def minimal_total_cost(n, m, roads): # Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2]) parent = [] rank = [] # Create disjoint sets for each intersection for i in range(n): parent.append(i) rank.append(0) total_cost = 0 edges_used = 0 for u, v, w in roads: # Adjust 0-based index u -= 1 v -= 1 set_u = find(parent, u) set_v = find(parent, v) # If including this edge doesn\'t cause a cycle, include it in the result if set_u != set_v: union(parent, rank, set_u, set_v) total_cost += w edges_used += 1 # If we have used (n-1) edges, we can stop (MST is complete) if edges_used == n - 1: break return total_cost"},{"question":"Alice has an array of integers of length `n` where each element represents the number of candies in a bag.

The wizards of the ancient world were clever; they have disguised their problem as follows: You are given an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, where each vertex represents a magic node and each edge represents a magic connection between nodes. Each vertex `v` has a power value `p_v`. Your task is to answer `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `u` and `k`, and you need to find the `k` highest power values among the vertices that are reachable from `u`.

She has a map of the park represented by an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, where nodes represent different locations and edges represent paths between these locations. Each location has a unique prize value associated with it. To make the hunt more interesting, Elena decided to apply the following rules: 1. Starting from any node, her friends can collect prizes from locations by following the paths. 2. They cannot collect prizes from the same location more than once. 3. They can revisit locations but will not get any additional prize from revisited locations. 4.

The problem can be modeled with a graph where the depot is represented as node 0 and each delivery location as nodes 1 through n-1. The edges from the depot to each delivery location have weights equal to the distance of the roads. Your task is to determine the minimal total distance travel required to deliver to all locations and return back to the depot.

Recently, she found a new game called \\"Sequence Merge\\". In this game, she is given two sequences of integers A and B, each of length n. The objective of the game is to merge these two sequences into a new sequence C by choosing one element from A and one element from B at each step, such that the sums of these elements are strictly increasing. More formally, let ( C[1], C[2], ..., C[2n] ) be the resulting merged sequence. Alice needs to pick one element from A and one element from B in each of the 2n steps to form this sequence with the following constraints: - ( C[1] ) < ( C[2] ) < ... < ( C[2n] ) - ( C[2i-1] ) is from A - ( C[2i] ) is from B for all ( 1 leq i leq n ) Alice is not sure if it\'s always possible to merge the sequences in such a manner.

Each username can only contain lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, digits, and special characters. However, to ensure better user readability, the system prohibits registration of usernames if the new username can be considered too similar to an already existing one, based on specific transformation rules. The rules for similarity are: * Replacing a digit with punctuation symbols or vice versa: - \'1\' can be replaced with \'!\', and vice versa. - \'7\' can be replaced with \'&\', and vice versa. * Transforming lowercase versions of alphabetic characters to uppercase and vice versa. * Shifting characters up by a certain amount in the ASCII sequence: - \'a\' can be shifted to \'c\', \'c\' to \'e\', and so on (two positions higher in ASCII sequence), and vice versa. For example, the usernames “UserName1!” and “usERnaME!!” are considered similar due to transformations of \'1\' to \'!\', upper to lower case conversion, and vice versa.

Each box can be moved in by being added to the right end of the queue or removed from the left end of the queue. However, if at the end of a day (a query) the box numbers in the queue do not form an increasing sequence in terms of arrival numbers, it means there was a mistake in the logistics. Write a function that processes a series of commands to manage this queue and then checks if the queue is in strict increasing order at the end of operations. A strict increasing order means for any position i in the queue, the value at i should be less than the value at i+1. Input: - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) - the number of commands. - The next n lines contain one command each. - Each command is either \\"ADD x\\" (where x is a positive integer to be added to the right end of the queue) or \\"REMOVE\\" (which removes the box from the left end of the queue).

Each chore i has a duration di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) and a stress level si (1 ≤ si ≤ 109). 3. m queries where each query is either: * \\"Q d\\": Find the minimum stress level of all chores that can be completed within duration d. * \\"U i d s\\": Update the duration and stress level of chore i to d and s respectively. Input The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105). The next n lines contain pairs of integers di and si, representing the duration and stress level of the i-th chore. The next m lines each describe a query in the format \\"Q d\\" or \\"U i d s\\". Output For each \\"Q d\\" query, output the minimum stress level among the chores that can be completed within the duration d. If no such chore exists, output -1.

Alice defines a sequence to be special if every element in the sequence (except the first one) is a multiple of its predecessor.

Each week, the publisher receives requests from multiple bookstores indicating the number of copies they need to restock each book. The task is to fulfill these restock requests while updating the warehouse inventory accordingly, and determine if any restock requests cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient inventory. You need to write a function that takes the initial warehouse inventory and a list of restock requests, and returns the updated inventory of the warehouse and a boolean list indicating whether each corresponding restock request was fulfilled successfully.

For the second bookstore, the request is for 100 copies of book 1, 200 copies of book 2, and 10 copies of book 3. The warehouse cannot fulfill this request because it has only 130 copies of book 2 in stock but needs 200. Hence, the request for the second bookstore cannot be fulfilled, and the result is `False`.

A common application of a trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary for a mobile phone. Tries are also widely used in IP routing tables for IP lookups, where the longest prefix match is used to determine the IP routing. A trie node contains three fields: 1. **Children**: A mapping from character to Trie Node. This is used to store the references to children for each trie node. 2. **IsLeaf**: A boolean flag indicating whether the node is a leaf node or not. A leaf node marks the end of a word in a trie. Here is the program that implements insertion, search and deletion operation on a Trie. Insert: To add a word into the trie, iterate through each character in the word and create a new Trie Node if the character is not found in the Trie. Mark the last node as leaf node. Search: To search for a word in the trie, iterate through each character in the word. If a character is not found, return `false`. If all characters are found and the isLeaf flag is true, return `true` indicating the word is found. Delete: To remove a word from the trie, first check if the word exists in the trie. If it does, remove the leaf node and recursively delete nodes up the trie if they are not part of another word in the trie. Implement the following operations for a Trie: * `insert(word)`: Insert the string `word` into the trie. * `search(word)`: Return `true` if the string `word` is present in the trie, otherwise return `false`. * `delete(word)`: Remove the string `word` from the trie if it exists.

Given the health of each monster and the damage of each weapon, Jon wants to know if he can defeat all the monsters using each weapon exactly once. Jon can only use one weapon per monster, and a monster is defeated if the weapon\'s damage is at least equal to the monster\'s health. Input - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of monsters. - The second line contains n integers representing the health of each monster. - The third line contains n integers representing the damage of each weapon.

Applicants are identified by their unique IDs, which are non-negative integers. To streamline the interview process, they developed a scheduling system that assigns a specific interview slot to each applicant based on a derived property of their unique ID. Given an applicant\'s ID `N`, the system calculates the interview slot using the following rule: 1. Convert `N` to its binary representation. 2. Find the sum of all digits in the binary representation. 3. Multiply this sum by a constant `C` to determine the interview slot. Write a program that takes multiple test cases, each containing an applicant\'s ID `N` and the constant `C`, and outputs the assigned interview slot for each applicant. Input Format: The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, `T`. Each of the following `T` lines contains two integers: `N` (the unique ID of the applicant) and `C` (the constant used in the calculation).

For the second test case, N = 15. The binary representation of 15 is 1111. The sum of the binary digits is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. The interview slot is 4 * 2 = 8. Hence, the answer is \\"Slot Case #2: 8\\". For the third test case, N = 8. The binary representation of 8 is 1000. The sum of the binary digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1. The interview slot is 1 * 5 = 5.

The participants need to paint exactly two parallel lines in a grid. The grid is represented as an n × m matrix consisting of unit squares. Amara wishes to find all the unit squares that fall on either of the painted lines but she doesn\'t remember their exact coordinates. However, we know the following information about the lines: 1. Both lines are vertical or both lines are horizontal. 2. Each line must cover exactly n or m unit squares, depending on its orientation. 3. The lines must be parallel, so if they are vertical, they must span the entire height of the grid; if they are horizontal, they must span the entire width of the grid. 4. The distance between the two lines is known and is exactly d units. You need to help Amara find the valid coordinates of the unit squares that could potentially lie on the two lines painted by participants.

Alice decides to split the cards into two non-empty sub-collections such that the absolute difference between the sums of the numbers in these sub-collections is minimized. If there are multiple ways to achieve the same minimal absolute difference, she prefers the one where the first sub-collection\'s sum is minimized. Help Alice to determine the minimal absolute difference she can achieve. Input The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), which represents the number of magic cards Alice has. The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10000), representing the numbers on the magic cards. Output You need to output a single integer which is the minimal absolute difference between the sums of the two sub-collections.

The kingdom has n horses, and each horse competes in exactly m races. Every horse races against every other horse exactly once throughout the series. Each race has two outcomes: one horse wins, and the other loses. To ensure fair play, the king asked his advisor to record the result of each race. Given the number of horses n, help the advisor determine the outcomes of these races such that each horse races against every other horse exactly once and there is exactly one winner for each race. Note that n horses will result in a total of (n * (n - 1)) / 2 races. Input The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of horses in the kingdom. Output Print the total number of races, followed by a list of results of each race. Each result should be printed on a separate line and should include two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b), where a is the winning horse and b is the losing horse.
