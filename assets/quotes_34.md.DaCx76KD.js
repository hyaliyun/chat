Each participant is given an array of integers, and the goal is to transform the array so that each element in the new array is the product of the integers at the remaining positions in the original array. Specifically, given an array of integers `a` of length `n`, you need to construct an array `b` such that `b[i]` is equal to the product of all elements of array `a` except `a[i]`. The rules: 1. You cannot use the division operation. 2. Your solution should have time complexity better than O(n^2).

Each of the next q lines contains one of the following operations: - \\"1 i c\\" (1-based index) means replace the character at position i with character c. - \\"2 l r\\" (1-based indices) means query the number of distinct characters in the substring from position l to position r (inclusive). Print the answer for each query of the second type. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type in the input. **Example:** **Input:** ``` 8 5 abcdefgh 2 1 8 1 3 z 2 1 4 1 5 p 2 4 8 ``` **Output:** ``` 8 4 5 ``` **Explanation:** For the initial string \\"abcdefgh\\": - The first query asks for the distinct characters from position 1 to 8. All characters from \'a\' to \'h\' are distinct, so the answer is 8. - After replacing the character at position 3 with \'z\', the string becomes \\"abzdefgh\\". - The second query asks for the distinct characters from position 1 to 4.

The distinct characters are \'d\', \'e\', \'p\', \'f\', and \'g\', so the answer is 5.","solution":"def process_operations(n, q, s, operations): s = list(s) # Convert string to list for easy manipulation results = [] for operation in operations: parts = operation.split() if parts[0] == \\"1\\": # replace character at position i (1-based index) i = int(parts[1]) - 1 c = parts[2] s[i] = c elif parts[0] == \\"2\\": # query number of distinct characters between l and r (1-based indices) l = int(parts[1]) - 1 r = int(parts[2]) substring = s[l:r] distinct_characters = len(set(substring)) results.append(distinct_characters) return results"},{"question":"Franz is working on a new type of autonomous delivery vehicle that navigates a grid city.

You need to determine the minimum total cost to connect all n fields to a water source, ensuring that each field gets exactly one pipe. The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of fields. Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi and ci (1 ≤ xi ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 1000) — the length of the pipe needed to reach the i-th field and the cost per unit length of that pipe. Print a single integer — the minimum total cost to connect all the fields. The input guarantees that each field needs a specific pipe length and cost and no two fields share the same position along the line. In the first sample, if we have fields needing pipes of lengths 1, 2, and 3 with costs 10, 15, and 20 respectively, the optimal solution may be computed by summing the cost for each pipe length at its respective cost per unit length. In the second sample, the scenario may provide different pipe lengths and costs, leading to a different minimum total cost calculation.","solution":"def min_total_cost(n, pipes): Calculate the minimum total cost to connect all fields with water pipes.

The goal is to leverage multiple processors in order to speed up the merging process. # Background Merging sorted arrays is a common problem in computer science with applications in various domains such as database management, file processing, and big data analytics. The classic approach for merging k sorted arrays, each containing n elements, is to use a min-heap to maintain the smallest elements of each array and iteratively extract the smallest element to form the final merged array. This approach has a time complexity of O(nk log k). With the advent of multi-processor systems, there is potential to improve the efficiency of this process by distributing the work across multiple processors. # Problem Statement You are given a set of k sorted arrays (each array containing n elements) and p, the number of available processors. Your task is to implement a parallel algorithm to merge these arrays into one sorted array using the available processors. # Input - The first line contains three integers, k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and p (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^3) — the number of sorted arrays, the number of elements in each array, and the number of available processors, respectively. - The next k lines each contain n integers, where each line represents a sorted array. # Output - Output a single line containing the merged sorted array of k * n elements. # Requirements 1. You should use a parallel programming approach to leverage the p processors. 2. The algorithm should be efficient in terms of both time and space. 3. Handle standard input and output for reading the arrays and outputting the merged array. # Example Input: ``` 3 4 2 1 4 7 10 2 5 8 11 3 6 9 12 ``` Output: ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ``` # Explanation In this example, three sorted arrays of four elements each are provided. With two available processors, the parallel algorithm should efficiently merge these arrays into a single sorted array: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12`. # Hints - Consider partitioning the arrays and assigning each partition to a different processor. - Use concurrent data structures to manage shared data between processors. - Think about how to combine the results from each processor efficiently.

However, being a considerate host, Santa has a condition: no two friends can sit in seats that are adjacent to each other.

During the bootcamp, each participant is paired with exactly one other participant to form a pair. If a participant is paired incorrectly, they would like to know the participant\'s correct pair. Each pair is denoted by a pair of integers. However, some pairs may be incorrectly listed. Therefore, they need to verify the correct pair listing from the majority of pairs involving each participant. To solve this, consider the following problem: You are given `n` pairs initially. Some of these pairs may be incorrect. Find the correct pairs by considering the majority occurrences per participant. Input: - The first line contains a single integer `n` — the number of initial pairs. - The following `n` lines each contain two integers `a` and `b` — representing a pair of participants (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5, a ≠ b).

Charlie\'s goal is to ensure that for every segment, the bus capacity should at least meet the passenger load. Specifically, you are required to adjust the capacity of each segment in a way that minimizes the total amount of increase in capacity across all segments. You need to find the minimum total capacity increase required and the new capacities for each segment. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of stops. Each of the following n-1 lines contains two integers ci and pi (0 ≤ ci, pi ≤ 100000) — the current bus capacity and the number of passengers on the segment connecting stop i and stop i+1. In the first line, print the minimum total capacity increase required. In the second line, print n-1 integers c\'1, c\'2, ..., c\'n-1 (ci ≤ c\'i) — the new capacities of the segments from the first to the last.

Each operation is defined as follows: - Replace all occurrences of a given character with another character. You need to perform the transformations in the order they are provided. After applying all the substitutions in order, you should return the final transformed string. The first line of input contains the original string. The second line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of substitution operations. Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated characters, `a` and `b`, which means replace all occurrences of character `a` with character `b`. Output the final transformed string after performing all the operations. # Example Input ``` abcd 2 a b c d ``` Output ``` bbdd ``` Explanation 1. Replace all \'a\' with \'b\' resulting in \\"bbcd\\". 2. Replace all \'c\' with \'d\' resulting in \\"bbdd\\". Constraints - The length of the string will not exceed 1000 characters. - The characters `a` and `b` in each operation will be lowercase English letters. - Each operation in the list should be applied sequentially to the string. Make sure to handle the transformations efficiently to ensure the solution can process the input within the time limits.","solution":"def perform_transformations(s, operations): Transforms the string s by performing a list of substitution operations sequentially. :param s: Original string :param operations: List of tuples where each tuple contains two characters (a, b) :return: Transformed string after performing all substitutions for a, b in operations: s = s.replace(a, b) return s"},{"question":"Vanya got a new bitwise game to play.

Each friend has a unique integer ID ranging from 1 to n. As part of the party preparations, Polycarpus wants to know if each friend is inviting a group of other friends, making sure no friend is left out. Each friend can invite a subset of other friends, and each group of friends invited by a friend is unique. Polycarpus wants to check if every friend can be uniquely placed into a group such that each group has a leader (the friend who is inviting them) and at least one friend is being invited by some other friend. If this structure forms a proper hierarchy or chain, he will proceed with the plan. Given n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5×10^3) and a list of groups where each group is composed of friends invited by a particular friend, determine if every friend can be uniquely part of this invitation chain. The input starts with an integer n — the number of friends.

In this game, two players face off against each other with their armies. Each player can perform two types of moves on their turn: `Attack` or `Defend`. Each player starts with a certain number of forces, and the game proceeds in rounds. In each round, players simultaneously choose their moves. The result of each round depends on the combination of moves chosen by both players: 1. If both players `Attack`, they inflict damage on each other. 2. If one player `Attacks` and the other `Defends`, the attacking player inflicts reduced damage. 3. If both players `Defend`, no damage is inflicted. Given the forces of both players at the start of the game, and knowing the number of rounds, you need to determine the distribution of forces after all rounds have been played. You are also provided with a log of the moves chosen by the players in each round. The force reduction is determined by two parameters: `attack_damage` and `defend_reduction`. When both players attack, each player loses `attack_damage` forces. When an attack meets a defense, the defending player takes damage reduced by `defend_reduction`. The first line of the input contains three integers: - `f1` (1 ≤ f1 ≤ 100), the starting forces of player 1. - `f2` (1 ≤ f2 ≤ 100), the starting forces of player 2. - `rounds` (1 ≤ rounds ≤ 100), the number of rounds. The second line contains two integers: - `attack_damage` (1 ≤ attack_damage ≤ 10), the damage inflicted when both players attack. - `defend_reduction` (1 ≤ defend_reduction ≤ 10), the reduction in damage when defense meets attack. Each of the next `rounds` lines contains two characters: - The first character is either `A` (attack) or `D` (defend) representing player 1\'s move. - The second character is either `A` (attack) or `D` (defend) representing player 2\'s move. Output two integers in a single line representing the forces of player 1 and player 2 after all rounds have been played. If any player\'s forces drop to or below zero at any point, the game stops immediately, and both players have zero forces. # Example Input ``` 10 15 3 2 1 A A A D D A ``` Output ``` 6 11 ``` Explanation - In the first round, both players attack, so both lose 2 forces. (8, 13) - In the second round, player 1 attacks and player 2 defends, so player 2 loses `2 - 1 = 1` force. (8, 12) - In the third round, player 1 defends and player 2 attacks, so player 1 loses `2 - 1 = 1` force. (7, 12) Thus, the resulting forces are 7 for player 1 and 12 for player 2.","solution":"def berland_battle(f1, f2, rounds, attack_damage, defend_reduction, moves): Simulates the Berland Battle game and returns the final forces of both players.

Recently he discovered an interesting problem involving array transformations. He defines a special operation on an array of integers. The operation is defined as follows: 1. Assign the value of the largest element in the array to variable `maxValue`. 2. For every element `e` in the array, if `e` is not equal to `maxValue`, add `maxValue` to `e`. Alex applied this operation multiple times and noticed that the array eventually becomes uniform, that is, all elements become equal to the maximum element present initially in the array. Given an array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) containing positive integers, you need to perform the operation as many times as required until the array becomes uniform and then print the resulting uniform array. # Input The first line contains an integer `n` — the length of the array `a`.

For example, if the set contains {3, 5, 7}, the minimal sum of a non-empty subset is 3 (the smallest element). Alex needs to perform a series of queries where each query is one of the two operations listed above or a request to retrieve the minimal sum of any non-empty subset currently in the set. The first line of the input contains an integer q (1 le q le 10^5) — the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains a query in one of the following formats: - `+ x` where x is an integer (1 le x le 10^6). This means to insert the integer x into the set. - `- x` where x is an integer (1 le x le 10^6). This means to remove the integer x from the set. It is guaranteed that x will be present in the set before this query. - `?` This means to output the minimal sum of any non-empty subset of integers currently in the set. It is guaranteed that the set will never be empty when the `?` operation is performed. For each `?` operation, output a single integer on a new line — the minimal sum of any non-empty subset of integers currently in the set. **Example:** ``` Input: 6 + 3 + 5 ? - 3 ? + 1 ?
