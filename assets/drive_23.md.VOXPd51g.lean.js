Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command: pip install Flask This will download and install Flask and its dependencies. Step 2: Creating a Basic Flask Application ------------------------------------------ After installing Flask, you can create a basic Flask application. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Inside the directory, create a new Python file (e.g., \`app.py\`) and add the following code: from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def home(): return \\"Hello, Flask!\\" if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) This code does the following: - Imports the Flask class. - Creates an instance of the Flask class. - Defines a route for the home page (\\"/\\") that returns \\"Hello, Flask!\\". - Runs the application in debug mode if the script is executed directly. Step 3: Running the Flask Application -------------------------------------- To run the Flask application, navigate to the directory containing \`app.py\` in your terminal and execute the following command: python app.py If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating that the server is running, such as: * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) * Restarting with stat * Debugger is active!
