Each row contains exactly n numbers and there are exactly n rows in total. # Output Format - A list of lists: representing the inverse matrix where each list is a row of the matrix. - Error messages: - Return `[[ -1 ]]` if the input is not a matrix. - Return `[[ -2 ]]` if the matrix is not square. - Return `[[ -3 ]]` if the matrix dimensions are smaller than 2x2. - Return `[[ -4 ]]` if the matrix is singular and cannot be inverted (determinant = 0). # Constraints - The matrix will contain integers or floating-point numbers. - Avoid using libraries like NumPy, use basic Python constructs. # Sample Input and Output Input ```python matrix = [ [4, 7], [2, 6] ] ``` Output ```python invert_matrix(matrix) # Output: [[0.6, -0.7], [-0.2, 0.4]] ``` # Evaluation Criteria - Correctness: Your implementation should correctly handle edge cases and produce the correct inverse for valid matrices. - Efficiency: Optimize recursive calls and matrix traversals to reduce time complexity, particularly for larger matrices. - Code Quality: Ensure readability, proper error handling, and appropriate use of helper functions for modularity. **Important Notes**: - You need to deal with fractional values meticulously to avoid floating-point precision issues. - Clearly handle all error messages for invalid inputs as specified in the constraints.","solution":"def get_matrix_minor(matrix, row, col): return [r[:col] + r[col+1:] for r in (matrix[:row] + matrix[row+1:])] def get_matrix_determinant(matrix): if len(matrix) == 2: return matrix[0][0]*matrix[1][1] - matrix[0][1]*matrix[1][0] determinant = 0 for c in range(len(matrix)): determinant += ((-1)**c) * matrix[0][c] * get_matrix_determinant(get_matrix_minor(matrix, 0, c)) return determinant def get_matrix_inverse(matrix): determinant = get_matrix_determinant(matrix) if determinant == 0: return [[-4]] if len(matrix) == 2: return [ [matrix[1][1]/determinant, -1*matrix[0][1]/determinant], [-1*matrix[1][0]/determinant, matrix[0][0]/determinant] ] cofactors = [] for r in range(len(matrix)): cofactorRow = [] for c in range(len(matrix)): minor = get_matrix_minor(matrix, r, c) cofactorRow.append(((-1)**(r+c)) * get_matrix_determinant(minor)) cofactors.append(cofactorRow) cofactors = list(map(list, zip(*cofactors))) for r in range(len(cofactors)): for c in range(len(cofactors)): cofactors[r][c] = cofactors[r][c]/determinant return cofactors def invert_matrix(matrix): if not isinstance(matrix, list) or not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in matrix): return [[-1]] n = len(matrix) if n == 0 or any(len(row) != n for row in matrix): return [[-2]] if n < 2: return [[-3]] return get_matrix_inverse(matrix)"},{"question":"# Bit Manipulation Enhanced Function In this task, you will use the basic bit manipulation operations to create a more complex function.

This characteristic makes it particularly useful in systems where write operations are costly. However, it operates with O(N^2) time complexity, making it inefficient for large datasets. We will explore an enhanced version of Cycle Sort that can handle a specific type of input efficiently but retains the core principles of cycle sorting. Problem Statement: Design an enhanced version of the `cycle_sort` function that can efficiently sort a nearly sorted array. A nearly sorted array is an array where each element is at most `k` positions away from its target position in the sorted array.

Output: * The function should return the sorted list of integers. Constraints: * The length of the array `n` is between 1 and 10^5. * `k` is an integer between 1 and 50. Performance Requirements: * Optimize the cycle sort to handle nearly sorted arrays, improving upon the O(N^2) complexity for this specific case.

Constraints: - You should handle edge cases such as removing the minimum from an empty heap. - The values inserted into the heap will be integers. - The Min-Heap should handle at least up to `10^5` operations efficiently. # Function Signatures: ```python class MinHeap: def __init__(self): Initialize the heap pass def insert(self, value: int): Insert a new integer into the heap pass def remove_min(self) -> int: Remove and return the smallest integer from the heap pass def min_child(self, index: int) -> int: Return the index of the smaller child of the element at the given index pass def perc_up(self, index: int): Percolate the value at the given index up to maintain the heap property pass def perc_down(self, index: int): Percolate the value at the given index down to maintain the heap property pass ``` # Example Usage: ```python heap = MinHeap() heap.insert(10) heap.insert(4) heap.insert(15) print(heap.remove_min()) # Output: 4 heap.insert(2) print(heap.remove_min()) # Output: 2 print(heap.remove_min()) # Output: 10 ``` # Tips: - Make sure to initialize your heap properly and handle edge cases. - Ensure that your `insert` and `remove_min` methods operate within O(log N) time complexity. - Consider using the given methods (`perc_up`, `perc_down`, and `min_child`) to help maintain the heap property after each insertion or deletion.","solution":"class MinHeap: def __init__(self): Initialize the heap self.heap = [0] # The zeroth index is not used, makes integer division straightforward self.current_size = 0 def insert(self, value: int): Insert a new integer into the heap self.heap.append(value) self.current_size += 1 self.perc_up(self.current_size) def remove_min(self) -> int: Remove and return the smallest integer from the heap if self.current_size == 0: return None # or raise an exception if preferred min_val = self.heap[1] self.heap[1] = self.heap[self.current_size] self.heap.pop() self.current_size -= 1 self.perc_down(1) return min_val def min_child(self, index: int) -> int: Return the index of the smaller child of the element at the given index if index * 2 + 1 > self.current_size: return index * 2 # There is only one child else: if self.heap[index * 2] < self.heap[index * 2 + 1]: return index * 2 else: return index * 2 + 1 def perc_up(self, index: int): Percolate the value at the given index up to maintain the heap property while index // 2 > 0: if self.heap[index] < self.heap[index // 2]: self.heap[index], self.heap[index // 2] = self.heap[index // 2], self.heap[index] index = index // 2 def perc_down(self, index: int): Percolate the value at the given index down to maintain the heap property while index * 2 <= self.current_size: min_child_index = self.min_child(index) if self.heap[index] > self.heap[min_child_index]: self.heap[index], self.heap[min_child_index] = self.heap[min_child_index], self.heap[index] index = min_child_index"},{"question":"# Context In computer systems, the order in which bytes are arranged to represent integer data is crucial for compatibility and proper data interpretation.

Problem Statement Implement a function `find_course_order(n, prerequisites)` that returns a list representing one possible order to take the courses if one exists, otherwise returns an empty list indicating it is impossible due to cyclic dependencies. Input * `n` (int): The total number of courses labeled from `0` to `n-1`. * `prerequisites` (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of prerequisite pairs `(a, b)` indicating that course `a` must be taken before course `b`. Output * A list of integers representing a topological order of courses if possible; otherwise, an empty list. Constraints * `1 <= n <= 10^4` * `0 <= len(prerequisites) <= 10^4` * Each `prerequisite` is a pair of integers representing a directed edge in the graph. Example ```python # Example 1: n = 4 prerequisites = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)] # The function should return [0, 1, 2, 3] or [0, 2, 1, 3] # Example 2: n = 2 prerequisites = [(1, 0), (0, 1)] # The function should return [] because there exists a cycle. def find_course_order(n, prerequisites): # Implement the function here ``` **Remark**: You are expected to use a topological sort algorithm (similar to the one given) to solve the problem efficiently.

Since 2 and 3 gets removed. The remainder is 4 which is unique and hence 1-sparse. 2. No other numbers are present. The single number in the stream is 2. 3. The numbers do not cancel out into a single unique number hence it\'s not 1-sparse. **BONUS**: For additional challenge, can you optimize the bitwise handling to work with more efficient space utilization?","solution":"from typing import List, Tuple, Optional def one_sparse(stream: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> Optional[int]: count_map = {} for value, sign in stream: if sign == \'+\': count_map[value] = count_map.get(value, 0) + 1 elif sign == \'-\': count_map[value] = count_map.get(value, 0) - 1 non_zero_counts = [key for key, count in count_map.items() if count != 0] if len(non_zero_counts) == 1: return non_zero_counts[0] return None"},{"question":"Scenario: You are a software engineer at a company that processes large datasets.
