Example: def outer_function(): enclosing_var = 20 def inner_function(): print(enclosing_var) # This will work because enclosing_var is in the enclosing scope. inner_function() 3.

Example: global_var = 30 def function(): print(global_var) # This will work because global_var is in the global scope. function() 4.
