Formally, the value of the nth coin can be expressed as: C_n = left( sum_{i=1}^{n-1} C_i right) + 1 For example, the first few coins in the sequence are: C_1 = 1 C_2 = 2 C_3 = (1 + 2) + 1 = 4 C_4 = (1 + 2 + 4) + 1 = 8 C_5 = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) + 1 = 16 Given an integer v, determine the highest denomination of coin that does not exceed v. # Input The input consists of a single integer v (1 leq v leq 10^9). # Output Output a single integer representing the value of the highest denomination coin that does not exceed v. # Examples Sample Input 1 5 Sample Output 1 4 Sample Input 2 20 Sample Output 2 16 # Note In the first example, the coins in the sequences are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,...

You are to help the ranger by writing a program to find out the maximum number of berries that can be collected within any given range of consecutive years.

To ensure optimal growth, she needs to provide a specific amount of water to each plant species in predetermined time intervals. Given the constraints of her irrigation system, she\'s using a network of pipes and valves to distribute the water efficiently. To simplify her task, she wants a program that will calculate the minimum number of water valves she needs in order to supply water to all her plants, each plant receiving the exact amount of water they require without any waste. A water valve can split the water into two equal parts, and each output can further be split using additional valves. A valve cannot be used to combine two or more water flows. The setup is as follows: 1. She can place an initial set of valves to split the main water supply. 2. Each valve can split the water flow into two equal parts. 3. All water meant for the plants must come from a single water source. 4. The valves and pipes must be arranged such that each plant gets exactly the amount of water it needs, and no water is wasted. # Input The input consists of an integer sequence. - The first integer indicates `N`, the number of plants in the greenhouse. - The following `N` integers describe the amount of water required for each plant.

A WPE encoded string is a sequence of triplets, each consisting of (value, frequency, duration). The objective is to write a program that reads a compressed audio waveform, applies a simple audio transformation algorithm, and outputs a new compressed waveform. The transformation algorithm normalizes the waveform such that each value is the average of its surrounding values and itself. If a value has no neighbor on one side, it only considers the available neighbor(s). Consider the input audio waveform below (each triplet representing value, frequency, duration): ``` (10, 440, 1) (20, 440, 1) (30, 440, 1) (40, 440, 1) ``` In the transformed waveform, the value at position 2 is calculated as the average of its neighbors and itself: (10+20+30)/3 = 20. The value at position 1, which only has one neighbor, is calculated as (10+20)/2 = 15. Audio waveforms are represented by a series of such triplets within a duration of up to 1,000,000,000 (10^9) units.

To accomplish this, the city assigns a unique crew to each park, with the goal of minimizing the total time required for cleanup. Each crew can only clean one park per day, and each park must be cleaned exactly once. You have been provided with a list of parks and the number of days it takes each crew to clean them. **Input:** The input will begin with a positive integer P (1 ≤ P ≤ 100), the number of parks. Following this, there will be P lines containing descriptions of the parks. Each park description contains: 1. An integer C (1 ≤ C ≤ 1000), the number of available cleanup crews. 2. An integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 7), the number of days within which the park needs to be cleaned. 3. C space-separated integers, each representing the number of days a corresponding crew would take to clean this park. **Output:** For each park, determine if it is possible to assign a crew to clean the park within the given number of days.

The constraint is that no two stones emitting similar frequencies can be placed consecutively, as it would disrupt the magical balance of the fortress.

Any resemblance to real programming languages, products, companies, or individuals is purely coincidental. Story You have been hired by a startup named SecureComms that is exploring innovative ways to secure textual communications. They have decided to use Morse Code as an encryption method as a means to transform plaintext messages. Your task as a software engineer is to create an encoder which can convert regular English text into Morse Code. Task Write a function `morse_encode(input)` that accepts a single argument: `input`, a string containing the plaintext message to be encoded. The function should return a new string where each letter in the input is replaced by its corresponding Morse code sequence, separated by a single space. Different words should be separated by a space-constrained sequence of slashes (`/`) serving as word delimiters.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list. Example 1: Input: N = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]] start = 0 end = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: The shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 which has 3 edges. Example 2: Input: N = 4 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]] start = 0 end = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: The shortest path from node 0 to node 2 is 0 -> 1 -> 2 which has 2 edges. Your Task: You don\'t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestPath() which takes an integer N (number of nodes), a vector of vector of integers edges where each pair represents an edge in the graph, an integer start representing the starting node, and an integer end representing the destination node. The function should return the length of the shortest path between the start and end nodes.
