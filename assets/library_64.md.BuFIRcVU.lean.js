Use generators instead of lists to handle large datasets in memory efficiently. 2. Utilize parallel processing using multiprocessing or concurrent.futures for CPU-bound tasks. 3. Consider using libraries like Dask for parallel computing or Apache Beam for stream and batch processing. 4. Implement fault-tolerance and retry mechanisms to handle intermittent failures. 5. Profile and optimize the pipeline to identify bottlenecks and improve performance. 6. Use logging and monitoring to track the pipeline performance and diagnose issues. 7. Ensure your pipeline is scalable by designing it to handle varying sizes and rates of incoming data. # Recommended libraries and tools 1. Dask: Parallel computing with task scheduling 2. Apache Beam: Unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing 3. PySpark: Fast and general-purpose cluster-computing system 4. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis 5.
