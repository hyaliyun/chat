There are n islands in total, numbered from 1 to n. Alice starts on island 1 and wants to visit island n. There are m bidirectional bridges connecting pairs of islands, each with a certain length. Additionally, there are k special ferries that also connect pairs of islands but Alice can only use each ferry once for free (she can also travel back and forth using a ferry). Every ferry has a certain travel cost. Alice wants to find the minimum cost path to travel from island 1 to island n, considering both bridges and ferries. She can use as few or as many of the ferries as needed, as long as she minimizes the cost to reach her destination.

Events must be processed in chronological order, maintaining a valid check-in and check-out sequence. Implement a system to handle two types of operations: 1. \\"IN identifier timestamp\\" — Records a check-in event for the employee with the given identifier at the specified timestamp. 2. \\"OUT identifier timestamp\\" — Records a check-out event for the employee with the given identifier at the specified timestamp.

Additionally, some cells in the grid are blocked, meaning the truck cannot pass through them. The blocked cells are given as a list of coordinates. The truck needs to find the number of different unique paths it can take from the start to the destination while avoiding the blocked cells.

He is currently working on a problem involving nested squares. Given an integer n, can you help Ilya calculate the number of distinct ways to build a nested square pattern of size n × n using squares of integer side lengths? A nested square pattern is made by starting with a square of size n × n, then placing a smaller square of size (n−1) × (n−1) inside it, and so on until a square of size 1 × 1 is placed. Two ways of constructing the nested squares are considered distinct if the sequence of the side lengths of the placed squares differs.

The labyrinth is represented as a grid of size `n x m`, where each cell can either be an open path (\'.\') or a wall (\'#\'). The archaeologists can only move up, down, left, or right to adjacent open path cells. They start at the top-left cell (1, 1) and need to reach the bottom-right cell (n, m) to find the hidden treasure. However, there is a twist: the labyrinth is cursed, and some walls may start collapsing, making paths impassable as they explore. Fortunately, the archaeologists have a special device that can place a limited number of stability charges on specific walls, preventing them from collapsing until they pass through.

The map also describes a magical property: Treasure is always buried at the lowest elevation in the deepest connected component of the forest, where a connected component is a set of cells that are connected on the grid via vertical or horizontal steps. Your task is to write a program that finds this magical cell with the treasure. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the grid (n x n). Each of the next n lines contains n integers — the elevations of the points on the grid. Each integer is in the range 0 to 10^4. The output should be one line with three integers: the row number, the column number, and the elevation of the cell where the treasure is buried.

You are given an array of integers and your goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a palindrome. In each operation, you can choose two adjacent elements and replace one of them with the other. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1], it is already a palindrome and no operations are needed. However, if it\'s [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], you can make it a palindrome by following these steps: - Replace the third element (3) with 4, making the array [1, 2, 4, 4, 5] (1 operation). - Replace the fifth element (5) with 4, making the array [1, 2, 4, 4, 4] (1 operation). - Replace the first element (1) with 2, making the array [2, 2, 4, 4, 4] (1 operation). - Replace the second element (2) with 4, making the array [4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (1 operation). Therefore, a total of 4 operations are needed. The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the length of the array.

The training dataset consists of n images, each image having a label (either 0 or 1). You decide to perform data augmentation to potentially improve the model\'s performance. The augmentation process involves a series of transformations applied to each image, which helps increase the dataset size artificially by slightly modifying the original images. Each augmentation can increase an image\'s classification accuracy or decrease it, depending on how it affects the features detected by the neural network. Before applying any augmentation, you need to determine which combination of augmentations maximizes the final accuracy for label 1 classifications while ensuring the dataset remains balanced between classes.

Example 2 **Input:** ``` abc ``` **Output:** ``` NO ``` **Explanation:** Each character appears only once, so it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a palindrome. Example 3 **Input:** ``` racecar ``` **Output:** ``` YES ``` **Explanation:** The characters \'r\' and \'a\' appear twice, and \'c\' appears once, so the string can be rearranged to form \\"racecar\\" which is already a palindrome.","solution":"def can_form_palindrome(s): Determine if it\'s possible to rearrange the characters of the string `s` to form a palindrome. :param s: A string consisting of lowercase English letters. :return: \\"YES\\" if it\'s possible to form a palindrome, \\"NO\\" otherwise. from collections import Counter char_count = Counter(s) odd_count = sum(1 for count in char_count.values() if count % 2 != 0) if odd_count > 1: return \\"NO\\" else: return \\"YES\\""},{"question":"In the world of PetLand, there are n pet stores and m paths connecting them. Each store sells a number of different types of pets. Some stores are more specialized, offering fewer types of pets, while others have a diverse selection. Each store has a specific list of the types of pets it offers, represented by positive integers. You are given the pet types available at each store and the direct paths between stores. The prices of pets are consistent across stores regardless of location. A pet lover wants to buy a specific type of pet but first needs to know how far they need to travel to get it. They begin their journey from a specific start store and plan to visit the nearest store that offers the type of pet they are looking for. The distance between two stores is defined as the minimum number of paths required to travel between them. Your task is to determine the shortest distance (number of paths) from the start store to the nearest store offering the desired pet type. If no store offers the specified type of pet, return -1. The input consists of: - An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of stores. - An integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ 10000) representing the number of paths between the stores. - An array of lists, where each list contains the types of pets available at the i-th store. - m pairs of integers (a, b) indicating a direct path between the store a and store b. - An integer start (1 ≤ start ≤ n) indicating the store where the search starts. - An integer pet_type (a positive integer) representing the type of pet the pet lover wants to buy. Output a single integer representing the shortest distance from the start store to the nearest store that sells the desired pet type. If there is no such store, output -1. Example: Input: ``` 5 4 [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 4], [1, 3, 4]] 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 1 3 ``` Output: ``` 1 ``` Explanation: Start at store 1.
