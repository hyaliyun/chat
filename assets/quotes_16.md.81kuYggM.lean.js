An email address consists of a local part and a domain part separated by \'@\'. For this problem, we\'ll assume the following rules to determine the final form of an email address: 1. Any dots (\'.\') in the local part should be ignored. 2. Any character after a plus sign (\'+\') in the local part should be ignored. For example, for the email address \\"user.name+spam@company.com\\": - \\"user.name+spam\\" is the local part. - Ignoring the dots, it becomes \\"username\\". - Ignoring everything after the plus sign, it remains \\"username\\". - The domain part remains \\"company.com\\". So, \\"user.name+spam@company.com\\" is effectively \\"username@company.com\\". Given a list of email addresses, compute the number of unique email addresses based on the above rules.

Given the light requirements of the plants and the lighting configuration of the greenhouse, your task is to find the maximum sum of light received by any contiguous subarray of plants.

However, the number that disappears leaves a \\"footprint\\" equal to its value, which is subtracted from all the remaining numbers in the list. Let me explain with an example. # Example Let\'s say we start with the list `[5, 3, 8, 10]`. On the first day, the first number `5` disappears, leaving behind a \\"footprint\\" of `5`. So the list becomes `[3-5, 8-5, 10-5]`, which is `[-2, 3, 5]`. The process continues with each day subtracting the footprint of the disappearing number from the list. In this case: - On the second day, the list is `[-2, 3, 5]`. The first number `-2` disappears, leaving a footprint of `-2`, resulting in `[3-(-2), 5-(-2)]` which is `[5, 7]`. - On the third day, the list is `[5, 7]`. The first number `5` disappears, leaving a footprint of `5`, resulting in `[7-5]` which is `[2]`. - On the fourth day, the list is `[2]`. The first number `2` disappears, leaving a footprint of `2`, resulting in an empty list `[]`.

The bell is rung several times, and the number of times it is rung each day is recorded in the village archive. The bell ringer, however, has a peculiar way of recording the bell rings. Each ringing session is marked as an interval [l, r], where l is the first ring counted and r is the last ring counted. Due to some historical errors, some of the intervals recorded in the archive may overlap. Now the villagers want to correct the archive and compile a list of disjoint intervals that accurately reflect all the bell ringing sessions. Write a program that takes a list of intervals and merges all overlapping intervals into the minimum number of disjoint intervals. Input - The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of intervals. - Each of the next n lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), the start and end of an interval.

Each Algorin possesses a unique power level, which is a positive integer. Arithmos believes in the power of subsets, and he decides to train his Algorins using subsets of their power levels. The training regime requires finding the maximum possible difference between the sum of elements of two non-empty subsets of Algorins\' power levels.

Riya wants to optimize the printing format so that each name is printed in the shortest way possible while ensuring that the IDs remain unique. Hence, for each participant: 1. The ID will be printed. 2. The initials of their first name followed by their full last name will be used.

She needs to write a program that ensures every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. Additionally, the program should ensure that each set of parentheses is well-formed and properly nested. For example, in the expression `(a+(b*c)-d)`, the parentheses are well-formed and properly nested. However, in an expression like `((a+b)*(c-d)`, the parentheses are not well-formed as there is an unmatched opening parenthesis.
