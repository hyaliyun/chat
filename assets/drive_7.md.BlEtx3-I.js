Instead, it only copies references to the original nested objects. Therefore, if the nested objects are modified, it reflects in both the original and shallow copied objects. # Deep Copy: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found within the original. This means that modifications to the nested objects in the deep copy do not affect the original object. # Use Cases & Pitfalls: # - Use a shallow copy if you have a flat (non-nested) data structure or if you do not need to modify nested objects. # - Use a deep copy when working with nested structures or when modifications to the duplicate should not affect the original data. # - Pitfalls: Using a shallow copy when you need a deep copy can lead to bugs due to unintentional modifications across the object and its duplicate. # Python's \`copy\` module provides both \`copy\` and \`deepcopy\` functions. # Importance: # Understanding the difference between shallow and deep copies is crucial in managing memory effectively in Python and preventing unintended side effects.

Each region has several cities, and each city will host one or more competition events across W weeks. The task is to devise a travel schedule for participants to maximize the number of events they can attend, while adhering to a set of rules and restrictions. The rules and restrictions are as follows: Participants are allowed to travel among M regions, denoted by indices from 0 to M-1. The competition starts in the region indexed 0 on a Monday. Each region is interconnected with other regions by direct flights, represented by an M*M matrix, named regionalFlights, which indicates whether there's a flight from region i to region j. If there's no flight from region i to region j, regionalFlights[i][j] = 0; otherwise, regionalFlights[i][j] = 1. Additionally, regionalFlights[i][i] = 0 for all i. Within each region, cities are interconnected by direct flights, represented by a 2D list of N*N matrices named cityFlights. cityFlights[r] represents the matrix for region r indicating the flights among N cities in that region. If there's no flight from city p to city q in region r, cityFlights[r][p][q] = 0; otherwise, cityFlights[r][p][q] = 1. Also, cityFlights[r][p][p] = 0 for all p. Each city hosts a maximum number of competition events in different weeks, represented by an M*L*K tensor named events, where L is the number of cities in each region. The value of events[r][c][w] indicates the maximum number of competition events hosted in city c of region r in week w. Flights between regions and cities can only be taken once per day, specifically on Monday mornings of each week. Flight time is negligible and thus, not considered. Each flight has a cost, represented by an M*M matrix named regionalCosts for inter-region flights and a 2D list of N*N matrices named cityCosts for intra-region flights. regionalCosts[i][j] and cityCosts[r][p][q] denote the flight costs. If there's no flight from region or city, the cost is 0. The total budget for all flights is B dollars. Additionally, participants can only attend an event in a city if they solved a problem in a previous event in the same or another city. Participants earn experience points for each event attended, represented by an M*L*K tensor named expPoints, where the value of expPoints[r][c][w] indicates the experience points earned in city c of region r in week w.

It deals with certain types of anomalies that are not covered by 3NF. - **Third Normal Form (3NF):** A relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transitive dependency exists, meaning non-prime attributes are not dependent on other non-prime attributes. - **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** A relation is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and, for every functional dependency (X -> Y), X is a superkey. This removes the anomalies that can be present even in 3NF. **Example of a relational schema that is in 3NF but not in BCNF:** Consider the relation R (A, B, C) with the following functional dependencies: 1. A -> B 2. B -> C **Checking 3NF:** - The relation is in 2NF as every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key. - Attribute C is non-prime and B -> C, with B as prime attribute (B is not a candidate key here). Since no non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute, the relation is in 3NF. **Checking BCNF:** - For A -> B, A is a candidate key (superkey). - For B -> C, B is not a superkey. Thus, the relation is not in BCNF. **Steps to convert to BCNF:** 1. Decompose the relation into: - R1(A, B) - R2(B, C) 2.
