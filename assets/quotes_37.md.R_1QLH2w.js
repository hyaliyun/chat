The second line contains n distinct strings, each representing an ingredient. Each ingredient\'s name consists of lowercase English letters only, with a length between 1 and 20 characters. Output all possible unique dishes that can be made using exactly three different ingredients. Each dish should be represented as a string of the concatenated names of the three ingredients in lexicographical order. The dishes should be listed in lexicographical order of their names. If there are no possible dishes, print a single line \\"Impossible\\". Please note that \\"unique dishes\\" means no two dishes have the same combination of ingredients, regardless of their order in the concatenation.

Tom is provided with an initial list of item quantities in each storage unit. After preparing the initial list, Tom will be answering a series of queries where each query asks for the sum of item quantities in a specific range of storage units. You are given an array `stock` of length `n` where `stock[i]` represents the quantity of items in the `i`-th storage unit, and `m` queries, each specifying a range `[l, r]`. For each query, you need to output the sum of item quantities in the storage units from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. **Input:** - The first line contains an integer `n` (1 leq n leq 100,000) — the number of storage units. - The second line contains `n` integers stock[1], stock[2], ldots, stock[n] (0 leq stock[i] leq 10^9) — the quantities of items in each storage unit. - The third line contains an integer `m` (1 leq m leq 100,000) — the number of queries. - Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 leq l leq r leq n) — the boundaries of the query, 1-based index. **Output:** - For each query, output a single integer — the sum of item quantities in the storage units from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. **Sample Input:** ``` 5 2 3 5 7 11 3 1 3 2 4 1 5 ``` **Sample Output:** ``` 10 15 28 ``` **Explanation:** For the first query, the range is from storage unit 1 to 3, and the sum of quantities is `2 + 3 + 5 = 10`. For the second query, the range is from storage unit 2 to 4, and the sum of quantities is `3 + 5 + 7 = 15`.

The feature involves managing friend requests and verifying friendships among users. Each user can send and receive a friend request. If a user accepts a friend request, both users become friends. Additionally, users can verify if they are friends with other users by querying the system. Formally, you are given a series of operations of the following types: - \\"FRIEND X Y\\": This operation means user X sends a friend request to user Y. If user Y accepts, then X and Y become friends. - \\"VERIFY X Y\\": This operation means you need to verify if user X and user Y are friends. Consider that friend requests are always accepted. If X sends a friend request to Y, they become friends immediately. Additionally, friendship is symmetric: if X is a friend of Y, then Y is a friend of X. Write a program that processes a series of operations and outputs whether the given users are friends after each \\"VERIFY\\" operation.

In the second test case: 1. Users 5 and 6 become friends. 2. User 5 and user 6 are directly friends, so the output for the first \\"VERIFY\\" is \\"YES\\". 3.

He wants to encode a message such that it can be transformed back to the original message, but using a different key for each encoding. Arin decided to use a special binary transformation. The transformation works as follows: 1. The original message is converted to a binary string using ASCII encoding of characters. 2. A key, which is a binary string of the same length as the encoded message, is used to XOR each bit of the message. 3. The result of the XOR operation is the encoded binary message. Given an encoded binary message and the key used to encode it, your task is to decode the message back to its original form. # Input The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) — the length of the binary encoded message and the key. The second line contains a binary string of length n representing the encoded message. Each character in the string is either \'0\' or \'1\'.

XORing each bit of the message with the corresponding bit of the key results in the original message: - `1 XOR 1 = 0` - `1 XOR 0 = 1` - `0 XOR 1 = 1` - `0 XOR 0 = 0` - `1 XOR 1 = 0` - `0 XOR 1 = 1` - `1 XOR 0 = 1` - `0 XOR 0 = 0` Thus, the decoded message is `01100110`.","solution":"def decode_message(encoded, key): Decodes the given encoded binary message using the provided key by performing XOR operation.

The bus system is designed in such a way that it is always possible to travel from any bus stop to any other bus stop through a series of bus routes. Each bus stop can represent an intersection, and each bus route can be considered a one-way road connecting two intersections. The length of a travel route from one bus stop to another is defined as the number of bus routes one has to traverse along the path. The shortest travel route from one bus stop v to another bus stop u is the route with the minimum number of bus routes. Alice lives near bus stop s and works near bus stop t. Every day she takes a bus following a fixed route with the bus stops enumerated as p_1, p_2, ..., p_k (where p_1 = s and p_k = t), and she never visits the same bus stop more than once during her commute. Alice\'s bus pass includes a route recommendation system which provides the shortest travel route from her current bus stop to her destination t. Whenever Alice deviates from this recommended route and chooses a different bus stop to travel to, the system recalculates the shortest travel route from her new location. Given the map of Techville and Alice\'s daily commute route, determine the minimum and maximum number of recalculations that could occur due to Alice\'s deviations from the recommended routes. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of bus stops and bus routes in Techville, respectively. Then m lines follow, each describing a bus route. Each line contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) denoting a one-way bus route from bus stop u to bus stop v. All bus routes in Techville are pairwise distinct, meaning that each ordered pair (u, v) appears at most once among these m lines (though both (u, v) and (v, u) can exist). The following line contains one integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of bus stops in Alice\'s commute route. The last line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_k (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, all these integers are pairwise distinct) — the bus stops along Alice\'s route in the order of her travel. p_1 is the bus stop where Alice starts (s = p_1), and p_k is the bus stop where her workplace is situated (t = p_k). It is guaranteed that for every i ∈ [1, k - 1], there is a bus route from p_i to p_{i + 1}.

An array t of length n where t[i] represents the amount of trash in section i. 4. An array c of length m where c[j] represents the cost per unit of trash for cleanup team j. Each cleanup team can clean multiple contiguous sections, but each section of the beach must be cleaned exactly once. Determine the minimum cost to clean all sections of the beach. Input The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is in the following format: n m t1 t2 … tn c1 c2 … cm n is the number of beach sections, a positive integer not exceeding 1000. m is the number of cleanup teams, a positive integer not exceeding 50. ti gives the amount of trash in the i-th section, an integer between 1 and 1000. ci gives the cost per unit trash of the j-th cleanup team, a positive integer between 1 and 100. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros. Output For each dataset, output in a line the minimum cost of cleaning all beach sections.

You need to answer `m` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), representing a subarray of `a` from the `l-th` to `r-th` position inclusive. For each query, determine the length of the longest ascending subsequence that can be obtained from that subarray. **Input:** The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the sequence `a`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) — the elements of the sequence `a`. The third line contains an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of queries. The following `m` lines contain pairs of integers `l_j` and `r_j` (1 ≤ l_j ≤ r_j ≤ n) — the queries. **Output:** Print `m` integers — the length of the longest ascending subsequence for each query. **Examples:** **Input:** ``` 6 1 3 2 4 3 5 3 1 6 2 4 3 6 ``` **Output:** ``` 4 2 3 ``` **Explanation:** For the first example: - The full array is `[1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`. A possible longest ascending subsequence is `[1, 3, 4, 5]` with length 4. - For subarray `[3, 2, 4]`, the longest ascending subsequence is `[3, 4]` with length 2. - For subarray `[2, 4, 3, 5]`, the longest ascending subsequence is `[2, 4, 5]` with length 3.","solution":"def longest_ascending_subsequence_length(arr, l, r): subarray = arr[l-1:r] n = len(subarray) if n == 0: return 0 # Initialize DP array to store the lengths of the longest ascending subsequence ending at each element dp = [1] * n # Compute the length of the longest ascending subsequence using a dynamic programming approach for i in range(1, n): for j in range(i): if subarray[i] >= subarray[j]: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) # The length of the longest ascending subsequence is the maximum value in dp return max(dp) def process_queries(n, arr, queries): results = [] for l, r in queries: results.append(longest_ascending_subsequence_length(arr, l, r)) return results"},{"question":"Given an array of integers, a \\"mountain\\" is defined as a sequence of consecutive elements that first strictly increase to a peak (the maximum value of the sequence), and then strictly decrease.

Each player will play exactly one match against every other player. After all the matches are completed, Shikamaru records the results in a matrix, where `results[i][j]` is 1 if player `i` defeated player `j`, and 0 otherwise. Note that `results[i][i]` is always 0 because a player does not play against themselves. Given the results of the matches, determine the minimum number of players that need to change their results (from win to loss or from loss to win) to make the tournament results consistent with a specific ranking (i.e., there exists a ranking of players such that every player who defeated another player is ranked higher than the player they defeated). Input The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), denoting the number of test cases. Their descriptions follow. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200) denoting the number of players. Each of the next `n` lines contains `n` integers (either 0 or 1), representing the results matrix. The `j`-th integer in the `i`-th line represents `results[i][j]`.

Each member brings a subset of their book collection to each meeting, hoping to swap their books with others. Over time, Sarah observed a pattern in how books are swapped among the members and decided to write a program to optimize the swapping process. Problem You will be given a list of members and the books they bring to the swap meeting. Your task is to find the maximum number of unique books that can be collected by a single member after performing the optimal swaps. Each book is represented by its unique ID (a positive integer). A member can only swap their books for books brought by others at the meeting. There is no limit to the number of swaps a single member can make during one meeting. For example, consider a meeting where there are three members bringing books with IDs as follows: - Member 1: [1, 3, 5] - Member 2: [2, 4] - Member 3: [3, 6] In this setup, if members swap intelligently, a member can end up with all six unique books. Input The input consists of: - An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) representing the number of members. - N subsequent lines, each containing the list of book IDs (positive integers) brought by each member. - Each list of books includes at least one book and at most 50 books, and no book ID exceeds 10^9.

Formally, a song duration will be given as \\"mm:ss\\", where \\"mm\\" is the minutes (00 to 99) and \\"ss\\" is the seconds (00 to 59). Leading zeros in the minutes part and trailing zeros in the seconds part should be ignored when comparing durations.

She has recorded her scores for the last \'n\' training sessions. She wants to identify the smallest sub-array (contiguous segment) of her scores such that the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to a given threshold \'k\'. This task involves two main steps: 1. Identify and print the length of the smallest sub-array whose elements\' sum is at least \'k\'. 2. If multiple sub-arrays meet this requirement with the same smallest length, print any one of them. If no such sub-array exists, print `-1`. Arya has asked for your help to accomplish this.

With the Premium subscription plan, Alex can listen to an unlimited number of songs, while with the Standard subscription plan, there is a daily limit on the number of songs that can be listened to. The service also imposes network bandwidth restrictions that can affect both types of subscriptions. Alex has compiled a list of songs and their respective sizes in megabytes (MB) and wants to determine how to maximize the number of songs he can listen to given the daily bandwidth limit. Your task is to write a program that takes in the total number of songs, the size of each song, the daily bandwidth limit, and whether Alex has the Premium or Standard subscription. If Alex has a Standard subscription, additional input will specify the daily limit of songs he can listen to. Your program should output the maximum number of songs Alex can listen to within the given constraints.

Here\'s how the robot can move: - Up (U) - Down (D) - Left (L) - Right (R) Given the number of moves the robot can execute and the dimensions of the warehouse grid, your job is to determine if the robot can reach the target cell from the starting cell using exactly the given number of moves.

Communication time between two servers is represented by a matrix where `comm_time[i][j]` denotes the time taken to communicate between server `i` and server `j`.

To make the race more interesting, he has decided to place a certain number of water stations along the route for the runners to hydrate. There are m water stations, each located at specific positions along the route (denoted as w1, w2, ..., wm where 0 < wi < n). The marathon consists of s stages, and the runners must complete each stage without running out of water. Each runner starts with an empty water bottle that holds up to c liters of water. While passing by a water station, a runner can fill their water bottle to its full capacity. The runner requires exactly 1 liter of water per unit distance. You need to determine the minimum number of stops a runner needs to make at the water stations to complete the marathon, ensuring that at every stage between two water stations, the runner has enough water to reach the next one. Input The first line contains four integers n, c, m, s (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ c, m, s ≤ 10^9) — the endpoint of the marathon, the capacity of the water bottle, the number of water stations, and the number of stages. The second line contains m integers w1, w2, ..., wm (0 < wi < n) — the positions of the water stations along the route in ascending order.

Your task is to implement the booking system with the following requirements: * Add a new car to the rental system. * Check the availability of a car for a given time interval. * Make a reservation for a car for a given time interval, ensuring no double-booking. Input The first input line contains a single integer t — the number of operations (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5). Each of the next t lines contains a single operation. The operations can be: * `addCar` followed by an integer carID (1 ≤ carID ≤ 10^5) - Adding a new car to the system. * `checkAvailability` followed by an integer carID, an integer start, and an integer end (1 ≤ start < end ≤ 10^9) - Check the availability of the car with carID for the period from start to end.

The robotic arm operates on an assembly line that processes various types of widgets. Each widget has a different production time associated with it. Your algorithm needs to determine the optimal order of production so that the total idle time of the robotic arm is minimized. The robotic arm processes widgets in a sequential manner – it can only work on one widget at a time. At the start of production, the robotic arm is idle and can begin working on any widget. Once a widget is completely processed, the robotic arm will immediately start processing the next widget in the schedule, unless it has finished all assigned widgets. The objective is to minimize the total idle time, which is the sum of the idle times (time periods when the robotic arm is not working due to waiting for the next widget to become available).

The goal is to determine whether the given flow satisfies the constraints of the max-flow min-cut theorem. Specifically, you\'ll check whether the current flow from the source to the sink is maximized. A valid flow must satisfy the following conditions: 1. Capacity Constraint: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the flow f(u, v) must not exceed the edge\'s capacity c(u, v). That is, 0 ≤ f(u, v) ≤ c(u, v). 2. Flow Conservation: For every vertex v (except the source s and the sink t), the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow. Mathematically, for all v ∈ V {s, t}: ∑ f(u, v) = ∑ f(v, w), for all edges (u, v) entering and (v, w) leaving vertex v. 3. Max-Flow Condition: The flow from the source to the sink should be maximized, meaning no more flow can be sent from the source to the sink without violating either the capacity constraint or the flow conservation condition. Given the initial flow, determine if increasing or adjusting the assignment can lead to a greater flow without violating the constraints, or verify if the current assignment already represents the maximum flow. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively.

Nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Node 1 is always the source, and node n is always the sink. No edge may have a residual capacity that makes it impossible to saturate capacity (fi + ri ≤ ci).

Recently, he came across a hotel with several rooms arranged in a straight row. Each room has a certain number of gold coins, and each room is either occupied or unoccupied. John suspects that the unoccupied rooms might have hidden passages with additional gold coins. To confirm his theory, he needs to repeatedly ask questions about specific rooms. However, John is only allowed to ask about the gold coins in individual rooms a limited number of times. Your task is to help John determine the total number of gold coins across all the rooms, taking into account that some of the rooms might have hidden passages that add additional coins to the total. # Problem John can ask about any room i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and get the number of gold coins in that room. Additionally, if a room is unoccupied, you need to treat it as if it has double the gold coins originally present due to the hidden passages. Write a program that: 1. Takes the number of rooms N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000). 2. Executes up to Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 20000) queries in the form `? i` where `i` is the room number. 3. Responds to each query with the number of gold coins in room i. 4. Calculates and outputs the total number of gold coins across all the rooms, considering the double value for unoccupied rooms. The input will be provided by standard input and the output must be provided by standard output. Note that you should ensure to flush the output after each query in your program. The format for queries and final output is as follows: 1. To ask a query about the number of gold coins in room i: ``` ? i ``` You will receive an integer in response, which represents the number of gold coins in room i.

Examples - Input: `[3, -2, 5, -1, 4, -10]` Output: `9` (The maximum subsequence is `[3, -2, 5, -1, 4]` which sums to `9`) - Input: `[-3, -2, -1, -5]` Output: `-1` (The maximum subsequence is `[-1]` with sum `-1`) - Input: `[1, 2, 3, -2, 5]` Output: `9` (The maximum subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, -2, 5]` which sums to `9`) - Input: `[4, -1, 2, 1]` Output: `6` (The maximum subsequence is `[4, -1, 2, 1]` which sums to `6`)","solution":"def find_max_subsequence(arr): Returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subsequence in the array. :param arr: List of integers :return: Integer, maximum subsequence sum if not arr: return 0 max_current = max_global = arr[0] for num in arr[1:]: max_current = max(num, max_current + num) if max_current > max_global: max_global = max_current return max_global"},{"question":"Ayesha is working on an algorithm problem for her coding class assignment. She needs to determine the shortest distance from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where some cells are blocked and cannot be traversed. You are given a 2D grid of size N x M filled with integers. Each integer represents a type of cell: - 0: Empty cell (can be traversed) - 1: Blocked cell (cannot be traversed) You can move up, down, left, or right from an empty cell to another empty cell. Your task is to compute the shortest path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (N-1, M-1). If such a path does not exist, return -1. Input: The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: - Two integers N and M denoting the number of rows and columns of the grid. - An N x M grid filled with 0s and 1s. Output: Print the length of the shortest path for each test case.
