Each merchant has a unique stall where they sell a certain kind of fruit. The marketplace is lined up in a straight row of n stalls, and each stall has a sign indicating the type of fruit sold there, such as apples, oranges, bananas, etc. As part of a festival, the mayor of Algorithmia has decided to organize a raffle where the townspeople can win prizes. To participate, each person must choose two different stalls (X and Y) such that the total number of distinct types of fruits between those stalls, including the fruits at stalls X and Y, is maximized. However, due to the high number of stalls, you need to help the mayor by writing a program that determines the maximum number of distinct fruit types between any two different stalls. Note that if X is before Y, you must consider all stalls from X to Y (inclusive) and count the number of distinct types of fruit in those stalls. Input The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of stalls in the marketplace. The second line contains n integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_n (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^5) — the types of fruit sold at each stall.

Your goal is to determine the maximum profit you can obtain by selling exactly k items from this set, subject to the condition that you can choose the selling price of each item as long as the selling price is not lower than the production cost of the item. To achieve the maximum profit, you can increase each item\'s selling price. The profit for each item is defined as the selling price minus the production cost. Your task is to find out the maximum total profit you can achieve by strategically choosing k items to sell at their respective optimal selling prices. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

Each order has a fixed number of points associated with it that you earn upon fulfilling the order. Your goal is to maximize the total number of points by fulfilling as many orders as possible given your stock of ingredients. The stock of each ingredient can only be decreased once per order, and each order must be fulfilled completely with the exact amount of each ingredient needed; partial fulfillment is not allowed.

Input - The first line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of operations. - The following q lines describe each operation in one of the following formats: 1. `ADD id seats fuel_type` – Add a new car with given ID, number of seats, and fuel type. ID is a unique integer (1 ≤ id ≤ 10^9), seats is an integer (1 ≤ seats ≤ 100), and fuel_type is a string with no spaces. 2. `UPDATE id seats fuel_type` – Update the car with the given ID to have the new number of seats and new fuel type. 3. `FIND min_seats max_seats fuel_type` – Find all car IDs that have seat counts between min_seats and max_seats inclusive and the specified fuel_type. Return the list of IDs sorted in ascending order. Output For each `FIND` operation, output the list of IDs that match the specified criteria. Each ID should be printed on a new line, and the lists of IDs should be separated by a blank line. Example Input ``` 6 ADD 101 4 petrol ADD 102 6 diesel ADD 103 5 petrol FIND 4 6 petrol UPDATE 103 7 petrol FIND 4 6 petrol ``` Output ``` 101 103 101 ``` Note In the example, initially, cars 101 and 103 match the first FIND query. After updating car 103\'s seat count, only car 101 matches the second FIND query.","solution":"class CarRental: def __init__(self): self.cars = {} def add(self, car_id, seats, fuel_type): self.cars[car_id] = { \'seats\': seats, \'fuel_type\': fuel_type } def update(self, car_id, seats, fuel_type): if car_id in self.cars: self.cars[car_id] = { \'seats\': seats, \'fuel_type\': fuel_type } def find(self, min_seats, max_seats, fuel_type): result = [] for car_id, details in self.cars.items(): if min_seats <= details[\'seats\'] <= max_seats and details[\'fuel_type\'] == fuel_type: result.append(car_id) return sorted(result) # Function to process the input and produce the output def process_operations(operations): car_rental = CarRental() results = [] for operation in operations: parts = operation.split() action = parts[0] if action == \'ADD\': car_id = int(parts[1]) seats = int(parts[2]) fuel_type = parts[3] car_rental.add(car_id, seats, fuel_type) elif action == \'UPDATE\': car_id = int(parts[1]) seats = int(parts[2]) fuel_type = parts[3] car_rental.update(car_id, seats, fuel_type) elif action == \'FIND\': min_seats = int(parts[1]) max_seats = int(parts[2]) fuel_type = parts[3] result = car_rental.find(min_seats, max_seats, fuel_type) results.append(result) return results"},{"question":"You are given a collection of N integers that might contain duplicates.

Each connection must be between the tops of two different towers such that the connections do not intersect. A valid configuration of non-intersecting connections will look like a series of concentric non-overlapping U-shapes. John is particularly interested in finding out how many such valid configurations can be made. Formally, John has `n` towers aligned in a straight line, and he wants to connect some pairs of towers with non-intersecting ropes. Help John calculate the number of different ways he can connect the towers with such ropes. Input The input consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of towers. Output Print the number of ways John can connect the towers with non-intersecting ropes. Examples Input 3 Output 2 Input 4 Output 5 Note In the first example, John has 3 towers. The possible valid configurations are: 1. No connections. 2. A single connection between the first and last tower. In the second example with 4 towers, the possible configurations are: 1. No connections. 2. A single connection between any pair of towers. 3. Two non-intersecting connections forming a U-shape (first and second, third and fourth). 4. Two valid single connections (first and third, second and fourth). 5. One connection between the first and last tower, one connection between the second and third tower. The output should be the number of valid configurations.","solution":"def calculate_catalan_number(n): Calculates the n-th Catalan number. if n == 0: return 1 catalan = [0] * (n + 1) catalan[0] = 1 for i in range(1, n + 1): for j in range(i): catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - 1 - j] return catalan[n] def count_ways_to_connect_towers(n): Returns the number of ways to connect `n` towers with non-intersecting ropes. # If there\'s only one tower, there\'s one way (no ropes) if n % 2 != 0: return 0 # We can\'t pair towers if `n` is odd return calculate_catalan_number(n // 2) # Example usage if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": example_input = 3 print(count_ways_to_connect_towers(example_input)) # Output: 0 example_input = 4 print(count_ways_to_connect_towers(example_input)) # Output: 2"},{"question":"You are given a string consisting of digits from 0 to 9.

You are required to implement the core functionality that handles user creation, login attempts tracking, and account lockout.

Greg needs to implement a function that evaluates an arithmetic expression given as a string. The expression contains non-negative integers and the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The expression can also include parentheses which can change the order of operations. The calculator should respect the standard rules of arithmetic operation precedence: 1. Expressions within parentheses \\"()\\" have the highest precedence. 2. Multiplication \\"*\\" and division \\"/\\" are evaluated next. 3. Addition \\"+\\" and subtraction \\"-\\" have the lowest precedence. 4. Operators of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.

Specifically, given a grid of storage cells, a set of commands to move items, and a set of queries, your task is to determine the stored value in specific cells after performing the commands. The commands are of two types: 1. MOVE x y a b: Move the item from cell (x, y) to cell (a, b). If the destination cell (a, b) already has an item, the move is invalid and should be ignored. 2. QUERY x y: Report the value of the item at cell (x, y).

Therefore, the output for the first week is \\"apple banana orange\\" and the total number of unique fruits is 3. In the second week, new fruit \\"grape\\" is introduced, so the output is \\"grape\\" and the total number of unique fruits becomes 4. In the second example, during the first week, unique fruits \\"apple\\" and \\"mango\\" are brought. In the second week, the new fruit is \\"banana\\".

Example: For the pattern \\"Tick Tick Tock Tick Tick Tock Tock Tick\\", we have: - Two \'Tick\', one \'Tock\' -> valid - Two \'Tick\', one \'Tock\' -> valid - One \'Tick\', two \'Tock\' -> invalid This pattern does not follow the rule since there\'s an instance where the number of consecutive \'Tick\' chimes is not greater than the number of consecutive \'Tock\' chimes. Input: - The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of chime patterns. - The next N lines each contain a chime pattern composed of the words \'Tick\' and \'Tock\', separated by spaces. Each pattern will not exceed 1000 characters in length. Output: - A single integer representing the number of days that follow the town\'s chime pattern rule.

Their goal is to find the shortest path from their starting point to their campsite located somewhere in the grid. However, the forest is not static. Over time, some of the empty cells may turn into trees, making certain paths impassable. To model this, after each move the friends make, a specific number of empty cells will turn into trees according to a predefined rule. Your task is to help the friends determine if they can reach the campsite and, if so, find the shortest path to get there before they get stuck for good. problem You are given a grid of size N x M where each cell is either empty (\'.\'), a tree (\'#\'), or water (\'~\'). The starting point is given as (sx, sy) and the campsite is located at (ex, ey). Additionally, after each move, an empty cell will turn into a tree according to a specific function `f(t)`, which gives the position of the cell that turns into a tree after `t` moves. The function `f(t)` is given as a sequence of positions with `t` ranging from 0 to T-1, where `T` is the total number of moves. If the friends make more than T moves, then no more cells turn into trees.

If the sum is not a prime number, the signal is considered corrupted. Write a program to determine whether each intercepted signal is accurate or corrupted. Your task is to: - Calculate the sum of the integers in each array. - Determine if the sum is a prime number. Input The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. For each test case: - The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in the signal array. - The next line contains N integers, representing the values in the signal array.

If no integers are collected, the product defaults to 1. - `SquareAccum`: Collects integers and accumulates the sum of their squares. Each container type shares a common set of methods: - `add(value)`: Adds a value to the container. - `output()`: Outputs the result based on the container type. Container definitions and operations are given in a script format as instructions. Each instruction is on a new line, and there are specific actions that can be performed: - `[container_type] [name]`: Creates a new container of type `[container_type]` with name `[name]`. For example, `Accumulator A1`. - `[name].add([value])`: Adds the integer `[value]` to the container with name `[name]`. For example, `A1.add(5)`. - `[name].output()`: Outputs the current result of the container `[name]`. For example, `A1.output()`.

She has a list of items with their respective reserve prices and a list of bidders with their maximum bids. The goal is to match each item to a bidder such that each item\'s reserve price is met or exceeded, and each bidder\'s maximum bid is not surpassed. Additionally, each item should be sold to the highest possible bid while ensuring that each bidder wins at most one item. Write a program to find an optimal assignment of items to bidders or determine if such an assignment is not possible. Input The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), the number of items and the number of bidders, respectively. The second line contains n integers, where the i-th integer ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 109) represents the reserve price of the i-th item. The third line contains m integers, where the j-th integer bj (1 ≤ bj ≤ 109) represents the maximum bid of the j-th bidder.

Each assignment satisfies the reserve price and does not exceed the respective maximum bid of any bidder. Note that other valid assignments might be possible, but any valid assignment can be printed. In the second example, item 1 cannot be assigned to any bidder because the only bidder willing to pay more than the reserve price of 100 has to be reserved for item 2.

Connect all villages such that there is exactly one highway between any two different villages without any additional alternative routes that may cause ambiguity in the shortest path calculations. 2. Ensure that each highway is incorporated considering the priority value of each village. Input The first line contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n*(n-1)/2), where n is the number of villages and m is the number of roads. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3), where u and v are the two villages connected by a road and w is the length of that road. The last line contains n integers, corresponding to the priority values p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9). Output Print n-1 lines, each containing three integers u, v, w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3), representing the newly constructed highways.

The traveler wants to visit each space station exactly once, starting and ending at the \\"Home\\" station. Given the distance between each pair of connected space stations, determine the minimum distance the traveler must travel to complete their journey. If there are multiple solutions, the traveler is just interested in the minimum distance. Formally, the network of space stations can be represented as a complete graph where each node corresponds to a space station and each edge represents the distance between stations. The goal is to find the minimum distance required for a tour that visits each space station exactly once. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 12), the number of space stations.

People communicate using strings of letters, and the mayor of Stringville has tasked you with an important challenge to improve communication efficiency. Stringville\'s language consists of a set of rules to compress strings using the smallest number of well-formed substrings. A substring is considered well-formed if it appears at least twice in the string and has a length of at least 2 characters. The goal is to determine the minimum number of well-formed substrings needed to construct the entire original string. Your task is to write a program that, given a string, computes the minimum number of well-formed substrings required to build that string. If it\'s not possible to use well-formed substrings (e.g., if the input string is too short or no valid substrings exist), return `-1`. Input The first line of the input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The following `t` lines each contain a string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) — the string for which you need to determine the number of well-formed substrings. Output For each test case, output the minimum number of well-formed substrings required to build the string, or `-1` if it is not possible. Examples Input 3 ababab abcabcabc abcd Output 1 1 -1 Explanation 1. For the string \\"ababab\\", the smallest well-formed substring \\"ab\\" appears 3 times. We can construct the entire string using just \\"ab\\", so the answer is 1. 2. For the string \\"abcabcabc\\", the smallest well-formed substring \\"abc\\" appears 3 times. We can construct the entire string using just \\"abc\\", so the answer is 1. 3. For the string \\"abcd\\", there are no well-formed substrings of length greater than or equal to 2 that appear at least twice, so the answer is -1.","solution":"def min_well_formed_substrings(t, strings): def find_well_formed(s): n = len(s) for length in range(2, n // 2 + 1): if n % length == 0: substring = s[:length] count = s.count(substring) if count * length == n: return 1 return -1 results = [] for s in strings: results.append(find_well_formed(s)) return results"},{"question":"A skydiving team is training for an upcoming competition. They need to practice jumping from various heights and ensuring they land as close to their marked targets as possible. The team is practicing over a region that can be represented by a 1-dimensional array of length n, where each element represents a potential landing spot. Each landing spot has a certain wind factor associated with it, which affects the accuracy of the jump. The landing spots are numbered from 0 to n-1, and the wind factor of each spot is given in an array. Wind factors are non-positive integers, as positive winds are not ideal for jumping. To minimize risk, the team leader wants to select the landing spot with the minimal absolute wind factor. If there are multiple spots with the same minimal absolute wind factor, the team should choose the one with the minimal index. Given the array of wind factors, write a program to determine the optimal landing spot given the constraints. # Input - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the number of landing spots. - The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (-10^9 ≤ wi ≤ 0), where wi represents the wind factor of the i-th landing spot. # Output - Print a single integer, the index of the landing spot with the minimal absolute wind factor. If there are multiple such indices, print the smallest one. # Examples Input ``` 5 -5 -1 -2 -1 -3 ``` Output ``` 1 ``` Input ``` 3 -5 -3 -3 ``` Output ``` 1 ``` Note In the first example, the smallest absolute wind factor is -1, which occurs at indices 1 and 3, but since index 1 is smaller, we select index 1. In the second example, the smallest absolute wind factor is -3, which occurs at indices 1 and 2, but since index 1 is smaller, we select index 1.","solution":"def find_optimal_landing_spot(n, wind_factors): This function returns the index of the landing spot with the minimal absolute wind factor.
