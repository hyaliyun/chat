They need to stack these boxes such that they form a tower with the maximum possible height, but there is a constraint: a box can only be placed on top of another if the label of the box on top is divisible by the label of the box below it. You are required to help the company find out the maximum possible height of the tower. Each box weighs the same, so the only constraint is based on the integer labels. Given an array representing the labels of the boxes, determine the maximum number of boxes that can be stacked following the rule.

Each drone operates based on a series of waypoints that define its flight path. Each waypoint is connected in sequence to form a straight line segment. A drone can move between waypoints in any order, but must travel along straight line segments connecting waypoints directly. The energy consumed by the drone to travel between two waypoints is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. However, the drone can only travel if it doesn\'t intersect with any obstacles. Obstacles are defined as axis-aligned rectangular boxes in the 3D space. Your task is to create a program that reads the waypoints for the drone, the obstacles, the start point, and the goal point. The program should compute the minimum energy required for the drone to travel from the start point to the goal point without intersecting any obstacles. Input The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset has the following format: n m x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... xn yn zn xmin1 ymin1 zmin1 xmax1 ymax1 zmax1 xmin2 ymin2 zmin2 xmax2 ymax2 zmax2 ... xminm yminm zminm xmaxm ymaxm zmaxm sx sy sz gx gy gz n is an integer indicating the number of waypoints. Each waypoint xi yi zi shows the 3D coordinates of a waypoint. m is an integer indicating the number of obstacles. Each obstacle is described by its minimum and maximum coordinates along each axis (xmin ymin zmin xmax ymax zmax). sx sy sz and gx gy gz indicate the coordinates of the start point and the goal point, respectively. All given coordinates are integer values, and the x, y, and z-axis values are integers between -1000 and 1000. You can assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 50. The start and goal points are guaranteed to be on waypoints. When n and m are both 0, it indicates the end of input.

Your task is to implement a function named `process_transactions()` that takes a list of dictionaries representing users and a list of transaction strings. Each user dictionary contains the user\'s `name` and their current `balance`. Each transaction string specifies the type of transaction along with the involved parties and the amount. Transaction types are represented in the following formats: 1. \\"DEPOSIT <username> <amount>\\" - Add the specified amount to the user’s balance. 2. \\"WITHDRAW <username> <amount>\\" - Subtract the specified amount from the user’s balance, only if the user has sufficient balance. If the balance is insufficient, the transaction should be disregarded. 3. \\"TRANSFER <from_user> <to_user> <amount>\\" - Transfer the specified amount from the `from_user` to the `to_user`. The same rules apply as for withdrawals: the transaction should only proceed if the `from_user` has sufficient balance. The function should return a list of user dictionaries with updated balances after processing all transactions. # Input 1. `users` (list of dict): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary has two keys: - `name` (string): The user\'s name. - `balance` (float): The user\'s current balance. 2. `transactions` (list of strings): A list of transaction strings formatted as described above. # Output - A list of user dictionaries sorted by their names (alphabetically) with updated balances. # Example ```python users = [ {\\"name\\": \\"Alice\\", \\"balance\\": 500.0}, {\\"name\\": \\"Bob\\", \\"balance\\": 300.0}, {\\"name\\": \\"Charlie\\", \\"balance\\": 400.0} ] transactions = [ \\"DEPOSIT Bob 200\\", \\"WITHDRAW Alice 100\\", \\"TRANSFER Charlie Bob 50\\", \\"WITHDRAW Charlie 500\\" ] print(process_transactions(users, transactions)) # Output: # [ # {\'name\': \'Alice\', \'balance\': 400.0}, # {\'name\': \'Bob\', \'balance\': 550.0}, # {\'name\': \'Charlie\', \'balance\': 350.0} # ] ``` # Constraints - It can be assumed that the users\' names are unique within the `users` list. - Transaction amounts are positive numbers. - Account balances are never negative. - Transactions should be processed in the order they appear in the list.","solution":"def process_transactions(users, transactions): # Create a dictionary for quick access to user balances user_balances = {user[\'name\']: user[\'balance\'] for user in users} for transaction in transactions: parts = transaction.split() if parts[0] == \\"DEPOSIT\\": _, username, amount = parts user_balances[username] += float(amount) elif parts[0] == \\"WITHDRAW\\": _, username, amount = parts if user_balances[username] >= float(amount): user_balances[username] -= float(amount) elif parts[0] == \\"TRANSFER\\": _, from_user, to_user, amount = parts if user_balances[from_user] >= float(amount): user_balances[from_user] -= float(amount) user_balances[to_user] += float(amount) # Update the original users list with the new balances for user in users: user[\'balance\'] = user_balances[user[\'name\']] # Sort users by name users.sort(key=lambda user: user[\'name\']) return users"},{"question":"Given an array A of size N, and Q queries, you have to process the following types of queries: - + x y: Add `y` elements all initialized to `x` to the end of the array. - * l r k: Multiply the elements from index `l` to `r` (both inclusive) by `k`. - ? l r: Print the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r` (both inclusive). -----Input----- - The first line contains two space-separated integers N and Q respectively. - The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the initial elements of the array. - Then Q lines follow, each line contains one of the above three types of queries. -----Output----- For each query of the third type, print in a new line the sum of the corresponding subarray. -----Constraints----- - 1 leq N leq 10^5 - 1 leq Q leq 10^5 - 1 leq l leq r leq |A| (where |A| is the current size of the array) - 1 leq x, y, k, A[i] leq 10^9 -----Sample Input----- 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 + 7 3 ? 1 8 * 2 4 2 ? 2 5 + 10 2 -----Sample Output----- 29 14 -----EXPLANATION----- Initially, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

If two messages have the same priority, return the one that was enqueued first. If the queue is empty, return \\"The queue is empty.\\". 3. `peek() -> str`: Return the message with the highest priority without removing it from the queue. If the queue is empty, return \\"The queue is empty.\\". 4. `is_empty() -> bool`: Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. Your implementation should maintain the time complexity for `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek` operations as O(log n). Here\'s the skeleton of the class: ```python class MessageQueue: def __init__(self): # initialize your data structures here pass def enqueue(self, priority: int, message: str) -> None: # your code here pass def dequeue(self) -> str: # your code here pass def peek(self) -> str: # your code here pass def is_empty(self) -> bool: # your code here pass ``` # Example Usage ```python mq = MessageQueue() mq.enqueue(5, \\"Message1\\") mq.enqueue(1, \\"Message2\\") mq.enqueue(3, \\"Message3\\") print(mq.peek()) # Output: \\"Message1\\" print(mq.dequeue()) # Output: \\"Message1\\" print(mq.dequeue()) # Output: \\"Message3\\" print(mq.is_empty()) # Output: False print(mq.dequeue()) # Output: \\"Message2\\" print(mq.is_empty()) # Output: True print(mq.dequeue()) # Output: The queue is empty. ``` # Constraints - The priority value is an integer within the range [-10^6, 10^6]. - The message is a string that contains only printable ASCII characters and has a length between 1 and 100. - You can assume the number of operations will be less than or equal to 10^5. Create the MessageQueue class following the provided details and ensure optimal efficiency for the required operations.","solution":"import heapq class MessageQueue: def __init__(self): # Initialize a heap and a counter for tie-breaking purposes self.heap = [] self.counter = 0 def enqueue(self, priority: int, message: str) -> None: # Use negative priority because heapq is a min-heap and we need max-heap behavior heapq.heappush(self.heap, (-priority, self.counter, message)) self.counter += 1 def dequeue(self) -> str: if self.is_empty(): return \\"The queue is empty.\\" return heapq.heappop(self.heap)[2] def peek(self) -> str: if self.is_empty(): return \\"The queue is empty.\\" return self.heap[0][2] def is_empty(self) -> bool: return len(self.heap) == 0"},{"question":"In a faraway land, there are magical forests known for their enchanted trees.

He recently came across the concept of geometric progressions. A geometric progression (a, r) is defined by its initial term a and the common ratio r between consecutive terms. Ken defines the geometric attraction of some array B of size M with a geometric progression (a, r) as |B_{1} - a| + |B_{2} - a * r| + ... + |B_{i} - a * r^(i-1)| + ... + |B_{M} - a * r^(M-1)|, where |x| denotes the absolute value of x. Ken has an array B of size M with him. He wants to find some geometric progression (a, r) with which the geometric attraction is minimized. Also, he is allowed to perform the following operations on this array. - Reverse operation: Select a subarray and reverse its elements. - Multiply operation: Select an element of the array B and multiply it by a non-zero integer. You need to help Ken decide how these operations should be performed on B and also in finding the parameters (a, r) of the geometric progression. Note that Ken can perform at max P reverse operations and Q multiply operations. ------ Scoring ------ For each test file, there will be a single test case. Your score for a single test file will be the geometric attraction of the modified array B and the geometric progression provided by you, divided by the initial size of array M. Your goal is to minimize this score. ------ Input ------ There will be a single test case. First line of input contains three space-separated integers M, P, Q. Next line contains M space-separated integers denoting array B. Next line contains Q space-separated non-zero integers, which can be used for the multiply operations. ------ Output ------ You can print at max P + Q + 2 lines. In the first line, print two space-separated real numbers denoting a and r, satisfying the constraints as mentioned in the constraints section. Then, you can print at max P + Q lines, with each line having one of the following two formats: Reverse operation = 1 l r: i.e., 1 followed by the indices (inclusive) of the subarray you want to reverse. Multiply operation = 2 i x: i.e., 2 followed by the index i of the element you want to multiply and the multiplier x. Please end your output by printing -1 in a separate line. Please ensure that the indices you are trying to manipulate actually exist, to avoid receiving a wrong answer. The indices should be 1-based. Also ensure that you respect the maximum P reverse and Q multiply operations. ------ Constraints ------ 1 ≤ B_{i} ≤ 10^{9} 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^{10} 0.1 ≤ r ≤ 10 Q = 10 ------ Example ------ Input: 4 2 2 4 16 64 256 3 2 Output: 4 4 1 1 4 2 2 3 -1 ------ Explanation ------ In this case, the array B is [4, 16, 64, 256]. Ken can perform at max two reverse and two multiply operations. He picks an initial value a=4 and common ratio r=4. He first reverses the entire array to get [256, 64, 16, 4]. Then he multiplies the second element by 3 to get [256, 192, 16, 4]. The geometric attraction of this array with the geometric progression (4, 4) will be |256 - 4| + |192 - 16| + |16 - 64| + |4 - 256| = 252 + 176 + 48 + 252 = 728.

Here is the problem statement they formulated: You are given an initial list of N players, each with an initial amount of items. You will process Q queries over this list. A query can be any of the following types: Type ADD_ITEM: u v - Adds an item of value v to player u. Type REMOVE_ITEM: u k - Removes the item with the k-th smallest value from player u\'s inventory. If the player has fewer than k items, this operation has no effect. Type MAX_VAL: l r - Finds the player with the maximum total value of items from player l to player r (1-based index; l and r inclusive). If multiple players have the same total maximum value, return the player with the smallest ID. Type MIN_VAL: l r - Finds the player with the minimum total value of items from player l to player r (1-based index; l and r inclusive). If multiple players have the same total minimum value, return the player with the smallest ID. Here is a detailed explanation for each of the queries: - ADD_ITEM: Adds an item of value v to player u\'s inventory (1-based index). - REMOVE_ITEM: Removes the k-th smallest value item from player u\'s inventory. If k exceeds the number of items player u has, this operation has no effect. - MAX_VAL: Returns the ID of the player with the maximum total item value between indices l and r (inclusive). If there is a tie, return the smallest player ID among the tied players. - MIN_VAL: Returns the ID of the player with the minimum total item value between indices l and r (inclusive). If there is a tie, return the smallest player ID among the tied players. INPUT: First line contains a single integer N - the number of players. Next line contains N space-separated integers where the i-th integer represents the initial total value of items held by player i. Next line contains a single integer Q - the number of queries. Next Q lines contain queries (one per line). OUTPUT: For each query of type MAX_VAL and MIN_VAL, print a single integer - the player ID with the maximum or minimum total value of items respectively (smallest ID in case of ties).

One of her tasks is to arrange networking sessions where participants from different companies can interact. Given a list of participants with their preferred time slots for the networking sessions, she needs your help to schedule these sessions to accommodate as many participants as possible while ensuring no participant attends more than one session. Each session can be held at one of the three available time slots: 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, or 4:00 PM. Each participant has a preferred time slot, which they would like to attend. The goal is to maximize the number of participants who can attend the sessions, given the time constraints. Julia has recorded the preferences in the form of a list containing tuples, where each tuple consists of a participant ID and their preferred time slot.

This utility needs to scan through a directory, compress all the files in it, and store the compressed files in a subdirectory named \\"compressed\\". Your goal is to use the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm for compression. This algorithm compresses sequences of same data values within a file. To compress, a sequence of the same value, `v`, that repeats `c` times is summarized as `v,c`. For example, `AAAABBBCCDAA` would be compressed to `A,4B,3C,2D,1A,2`. To handle files: - You need to list all files in the given directory. - Compress each file using the RLE algorithm. - Save each compressed file in the \\"compressed\\" subdirectory with the same name and a `.rle` extension. Write a Python function to do this. The function should take a single string argument representing the path of the directory to scan. If the \\"compressed\\" subdirectory does not exist in the given directory, create it. Ensure that the function handles text files only. Use the following structure and ensure you adhere to it strictly: -----Input----- The function will be called as: `compress_directory(path: str) -> None` where `path` is the absolute path of the directory containing the files to be compressed. -----Output----- No standard output is required. The function should write compressed files to the \\"compressed\\" subdirectory within the given directory path. You may assume that the input directory path is valid and contains text files only. You do not need to handle corrupted files or invalid paths.

There are M caves labelled from 1 to M and each cave has a secret treasure. Dave starts from the kth cave and explores each cave sequentially. Given that Dave wants to calculate the total number of unique caves he can visit (including the starting cave), you are required to determine the number of unique caves he will visit. The number of caves (M) is determined by the logarithm base 2 of Rounded(H, decimal), which is the number of hikers in Dave\'s group, where H is provided as an input. Round the value of H to the nearest whole number to get the effective hikers count. Note: For simplicity, ceiling value of the log2(H) can be taken to determine the value of M. Example 1: Input: k = 3, H = 15.6 Output: 5 Explanation: H rounds to 16, and log2(16) is 4. So M = 4, making total caves to explore = 4+1-3, which results to 2 unique caves Dave will visit Example 2: Input: k = 1, H = 63 Output: 7 Explanation: H already a whole number, and log2(63) rounded off to nearest whole is 6, So M = 6, making total caves to explore = 6 + 1 - 1 = 6 unique caves Dave will visit.

It turns at specific points, and each segment has a different width and depth, which makes calculating its length a challenging task.

You are also given the width and depth of each segment. To approximate the total length of Serpentine River, you need to account for the varying width and depth of each segment. The length of a segment of the river can be given by Euclidean distance between its endpoints, and this length is then adjusted by a factor determined by the width and depth of the segment. The adjusted length for each segment is calculated as: [ text{adjusted_length}_i = d_i times (1 + frac{w_i}{D}) ] where: - ( d_i ) is the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of the i-th segment. - ( w_i ) is the width of the i-th segment. - ( D ) is a constant factor that can be assumed to be 1000.

Each flower emits a magical energy represented by a positive integer. These flowers are planted in a rectangular garden with N rows and M columns. The energy emitted by the flower in the i-th row and j-th column is denoted by E[i][j]. The Queen of Byteland wants to maximize the total energy collected during her visit. To do this, she will start at any flower on the top row (i.e., any cell in the first row), and end at any flower on the bottom row (i.e., any cell in the last row). From any flower at position (i, j), she can move to the flower directly below it (i+1, j), directly below-left (i+1, j-1), or directly below-right (i+1, j+1).
