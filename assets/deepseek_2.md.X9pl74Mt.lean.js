You are given several queries to find the shortest distance between different pairs of cities. Help the magician to determine the shortest path for each query using the provided pathways. Input: First line of input contains number of Test Cases T. Each test case starts with an integer C, the number of cities, followed by an integer P, the number of pathways. In the next P lines, each line contains three space-separated values: city1, city2 (representing a pathway between city1 and city2) and an integer d (distance of the pathway). Next, an integer Q follows which represents the number of queries. For each query, there are two integers city1 and city2, representing the start and end cities for which the shortest path distance is to be determined. Output: For each query, print the shortest distance between the given pairs of cities. If there is no possible path, print -1.

Every time they request dish `k`, it must be prepared fresh. Each preparation of dish `k` requires a certain number of minutes, denoted by `p`. Given the total time units (in minutes) available for the feast and a list of time units required to prepare each requested dish (including the favorite dish `k`), determine if it is possible to complete the feast and how much time would be left after serving the king\'s dish `m` times.

In this exercise, you\'re asked to use a genetic algorithm to find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. The grid is represented as a 2D list of dimensions `n x m`, where some cells are walkable (represented by 0), and others are obstacles (represented by 1). The goal is to navigate from the cell (0, 0) to the cell (n-1, m-1). # Requirements: 1. Implement a class `GeneticPathFinder` with the following methods: - `__init__(self, grid: List[List[int]], population_size: int, mutation_rate: float, generations: int)`: Initializes the class with the grid, the initial population size, the mutation rate (a float between 0 and 1), and the number of generations. - `generate_population(self) -> List[str]`: Generates an initial population. Each path can be represented as a string of directions: `U` for up, `D` for down, `L` for left, `R` for right. The length of each path should be `n + m - 2`. - `fitness(self, path: str) -> int`: Evaluates the fitness of a path based on the number of steps it takes to reach the goal and how many obstacles it encounters. A path that reaches the goal with fewer obstacles is more fit. - `crossover(self, path1: str, path2: str) -> str`: Performs a crossover operation between two paths and returns a new path. - `mutate(self, path: str) -> str`: Mutates the given path by randomly changing one or more directions based on the mutation rate. - `evolve(self) -> str`: Runs the genetic algorithm for the given number of generations and returns the best path found. 2. The class should follow these steps: 1. Generate the initial population. 2. Evaluate the fitness of all paths in the population. 3. Select parents based on their fitness to create a new population. 4. Perform crossover and mutation to create new paths. 5. Repeat the process for the given number of generations. 3. Constraints: - The grid dimensions `n` and `m` are between 2 and 20. - The population size is between 10 and 100. - The mutation rate is between 0.01 and 0.1. - The number of generations is between 100 and 1000. # Example: ```python grid = [ [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0] ] finder = GeneticPathFinder(grid=grid, population_size=50, mutation_rate=0.05, generations=200) best_path = finder.evolve() print(best_path) # Output: A string representing the directions of the path, e.g. \\"DDRRUURD\\" ``` # Notes: - The pathfinding should adhere to the grid boundaries and avoid obstacles. - If there are multiple paths with the same fitness, any of the valid paths is acceptable. - Ensure your algorithm can handle scenarios where no valid path exists. In such cases, return an empty string or a message indicating the failure. By the end of this task, you should have a `GeneticPathFinder` class that can find a near-optimal path in a grid using genetic algorithm principles.","solution":"import random class GeneticPathFinder: def __init__(self, grid, population_size, mutation_rate, generations): self.grid = grid self.n = len(grid) self.m = len(grid[0]) self.population_size = population_size self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate self.generations = generations self.directions = [\'U\', \'D\', \'L\', \'R\'] # Available directions def generate_population(self): population = [] for _ in range(self.population_size): path = \'\'.join(random.choices(\'DR\', k=self.n + self.m - 2)) population.append(self._ensure_valid_initial_path(path)) return population def _ensure_valid_initial_path(self, path): # Convert to valid initial path ensuring it can potentially reach destination d_count = path.count(\'D\') r_count = path.count(\'R\') while d_count > self.n - 1: path = path.replace(\'D\', \'R\', 1) d_count -= 1 r_count += 1 while r_count > self.m - 1: path = path.replace(\'R\', \'D\', 1) d_count += 1 r_count -= 1 return path def fitness(self, path): x, y = 0, 0 for move in path: if move == \'U\': if x > 0: x -= 1 elif move == \'D\': if x < self.n - 1: x += 1 elif move == \'L\': if y > 0: y -= 1 elif move == \'R\': if y < self.m - 1: y += 1 if self.grid[x][y] == 1: return float(\'inf\') return abs(x - (self.n - 1)) + abs(y - (self.m - 1)) # Manhattan distance to goal def crossover(self, path1, path2): cut = random.randint(1, len(path1) - 2) return path1[:cut] + path2[cut:] def mutate(self, path): path = list(path) for i in range(len(path)): if random.random() < self.mutation_rate: path[i] = random.choice(self.directions) return \'\'.join(path) def evolve(self): population = self.generate_population() for _ in range(self.generations): population = sorted(population, key=self.fitness) if self.fitness(population[0]) == 0: break next_gen = population[:self.population_size // 2] while len(next_gen) < self.population_size: parents = random.sample(population[:self.population_size // 2], 2) child = self.crossover(parents[0], parents[1]) next_gen.append(self.mutate(child)) population = next_gen best_path = min(population, key=self.fitness) if self.fitness(best_path) == float(\'inf\'): return \\"\\" # No valid path return best_path"},{"question":"----- SHOPPING CART ----- A local grocery store uses an electronic system for tracking their daily sales.

The editor can manipulate a 2D canvas of pixels (represented as a matrix) with the following operations: 1. Fill a subrectangle with a specific color. 2. Flip the contents of the canvas horizontally. 3. Flip the contents of the canvas vertically. 4. Rotate the entire canvas 90 degrees clockwise. 5. Rotate the entire canvas 90 degrees counterclockwise. Here’s how these operations should work: - **Fill**: Given the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of a subrectangle and a color, fill the subrectangle with the specified color. - **Horizontal Flip**: Reverse the order of pixels in each row of the canvas. - **Vertical Flip**: Reverse the order of pixels in each column of the canvas. - **Rotate Clockwise**: Rotate the entire canvas 90 degrees clockwise. - **Rotate Counterclockwise**: Rotate the entire canvas 90 degrees counterclockwise. Constraints The input satisfies the following conditions: - 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 (size of the canvas along each dimension) - 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 (number of operations) - 0 ≤ ai,j ≤ 255 (initial grayscale value of each pixel) - 0 ≤ r1, c1, r2, c2 < n (coordinates for fill operation) - 0 ≤ color ≤ 255 (new grayscale value for fill operation) Input The input consists of: - An integer n, the size of the n x n canvas. - n lines of n integers each, representing the initial grayscale values of the canvas. - An integer m, the number of operations. - m lines where each line represents an operation.

You are given an array of unique integers `participant_ids` of length `n`, representing the IDs of participants who have successfully registered. The IDs are guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to `n + m` (inclusive), where `m` is the number of missing participants.

The next line consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 le n, m le 10^5) separated by a space — the length of the `participant_ids` array and the number of missing participants, respectively. The next line contains `n` unique integers representing the `participant_ids` — the IDs of participants currently registered. It is guaranteed that the sum of all `n` across all test cases will not exceed 10^6. ----------Output---------- For each test case, output a single line containing the `m` missing participant IDs in ascending order, separated by spaces. ----------Example---------- Input 2 5 2 1 2 4 6 7 3 1 1 2 4 Output 3 5 3 ----------Note---------- In the first test case, the range of IDs is from 1 to 7.

You are given a list of project assignments where each assignment contains the `project_id` and `device_id`. Your task is to write a program that determines the maximum number of devices that can be active per project while respecting their respective license types. *If a project has a \\"single\\" license and multiple devices assigned to it, only one device should be counted as active. Projects with a \\"multi\\" license can have all assigned devices counted as active.* Input The first input line contains an integer n indicating the number of projects (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next n lines each contain the `project_id` (a string of length between 1 and 100 inclusive), and the `license_type` (\\"single\\" or \\"multi\\"). The next line contains an integer m indicating the number of assignments (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). The following m lines each contain a `project_id` and `device_id` (both strings of length between 1 and 100 inclusive). Output The output should contain n lines, each with the `project_id` and the count of devices that should be active for each project based on its license type.

Given the start and end times of `N` activities, determine the maximum number of activities you can attend. -----Input----- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 leq N leq 10^5), the number of activities. Each of the next `N` lines contains two integers `s_i` and `e_i` (1 leq s_i < e_i leq 10^5), representing the start and end times of the activities. -----Output----- Print the maximum number of non-overlapping activities you can attend. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 4 0 6 Output 2 Input 4 1 3 2 4 3 5 6 7 Output 3 Input 5 7 9 0 1 2 4 1 3 3 5 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first example, you can attend the activities with time intervals [1, 2] and [3, 4]. Therefore, the maximum number of non-overlapping activities you can attend is 2. In the second example, the optimal set of activities to attend are those with time intervals [1, 3], [3, 5], and [6, 7], giving a total of 3 non-overlapping activities. In the third example, an optimal set of activities would be those with time intervals [0, 1], [2, 4], [3, 5], and [7, 9], allowing for 4 non-overlapping activities.","solution":"def max_non_overlapping_activities(N, activities): # Sort activities by their end time activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]) # Initialize the count of non-overlapping activities count = 0 last_end_time = 0 # Iterate through the sorted activities for start, end in activities: if start >= last_end_time: count += 1 # Select the activity last_end_time = end # Update the end time of the last selected activity return count"},{"question":"You are given an array b of m integers. In one operation you can invert any single integer (i.e., change a positive integer to its negative counterpart or vice versa). Let\'s define the balance of the array as the absolute difference between the sum of the positive integers and the absolute sum of the negative integers. Your task is to find the minimal balance of the array b if you are allowed to make at most l operations. For example, for array [3, -1, 2, -3], the balance is |3 + 2 - (1 + 3)| = |5 - 4| = 1. -----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases.

After that the array b is [3, 1, 2, -3], so the balance is |3 + 1 + 2 - 3| = |6 - 3| = 3. In the second test case you can invert -5 to 5 and -7 to 7. After that the array b is [5, 6, 7], so the balance is |5 + 6 + 7| = 18. In the third test case no operations are needed since the number of allowed operations is zero.

One such problem presented to you is to achieve precise control over robotic arms in a factory setting. The robotic arms need to reach specific coordinates in a 2D plane to pick up or place items, and each command only allows the arm to stretch or shrink to a new position. Your task is to develop a software that helps control these robotic arms efficiently. The robotic arm can only move in a straight line along one of the Cartesian axes (either the x-axis or y-axis) with each given command. Movements in this problem are based on three types of commands: MOVE_X, MOVE_Y, and POSITION. - MOVE_X dx: This command moves the current horizontal position of the robot arm by dx units along the x-axis. - MOVE_Y dy: This command moves the current vertical position of the robot arm by dy units along the y-axis. - POSITION x y: This command moves the robot arm directly to the coordinates (x, y). Your program must process a series of commands and compute the final position of the robotic arm on the Cartesian plane, starting from the origin (0, 0). Input - The input consists of multiple data sets. - Each data set starts with an integer n (1 <= n <= 1000), representing the number of commands. - The next n lines contain one command per line in one of the formats described above (MOVE_X dx, MOVE_Y dy, or POSITION x y). - The end of input is signaled by a data set with n = 0. Output - For each data set, output the resulting coordinates of the robotic arm after executing all the commands.

The trail has markers at regular intervals, and we want to know when all the hikers will next meet at the starting point together. Each hiker has a different walking speed, which is the number of minutes it takes for them to reach the next marker. Given their walking speeds, find the time in minutes when all hikers will be at the start of the trail together for the first time after starting. -----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 leq t leq 1000) — the number of test cases.

Your task is to help Alice determine the minimum width of the wall required to display all given paintings together along with the necessary gaps between paintings of different artists. Each painting has a width of `1` unit and each gap has a width of `2` units. # Example: For `paintings = [3, 2, 1]` (3 paintings by artist 1, 2 paintings by artist 2, and 1 painting by artist 3), the output should be `10`. Explanation: Alice must arrange the paintings as follows: `|| || || || || || || ||`. Here, completing 3 + 2 + 1 paintings by different artists would require 2 gaps of width `2` units each, making a total length of `10` units. For `paintings = [4, 2, 1]`, the output should be `11`.

The number line has several lily pads positioned at different distances from the start, where the frog can land and rest. The distance between the starting point and each lily pad is given in an array. The frog\'s energy is consumed during jumps to the lily pads as follows: - If the frog\'s energy level `currentEnergy` is greater than or equal to the distance to the next lily pad, the frog can jump directly to it. - After hopping to the next lily pad, the frog\'s energy decreases by the distance hopped. - If at any point the frog\'s energy level is less than the required distance to the next lily pad, the frog cannot continue.

In this task, you are to determine the largest possible sequence of identical items that can be cleared in one move. The game grid is represented as an `n x n` matrix, where each cell contains an integer representing the type of item present. A move consists of swapping two adjacent items (either horizontally or vertically) to form a horizontally or vertically aligned sequence of three or more identical items. However, if there are no possible sequences that can be formed in one move, output `0`. Input The first line contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the size of the grid. Each of the next `n` lines contains `n` space-separated integers representing the grid (each integer is between 1 and 9).

Each city is represented as a point on a Cartesian plane, with its x and y coordinates given as (xi, yi). The roads in this country satisfy the following constraints: * Every pair of distinct cities is connected by exactly one direct road. * No three cities are collinear. The government has a special demand: for each query, they want to know the shortest direct road between any two distinct cities. However, this demand needs to be satisfied very quickly, and that\'s where you come in. Your task is to process multiple queries efficiently. Each query gives you the indices of two cities, and you need to calculate the Euclidean distance between them.

A priority queue is a special type of queue in which elements are removed based on priority rather than the order in which they arrive.

However, to master priority queues, the frog needs to practice a basic yet powerful operation: the merging of two heaps. Given two binary heaps (both max-heaps), implement a program that merges them into a single max-heap. A max-heap is a binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children. The merging process should maintain the properties of the max-heap. The frog is provided with two heaps represented as arrays.
