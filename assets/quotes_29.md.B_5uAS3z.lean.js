The algorithm sorts the array such that the integer 1 appears at the index 0, 2 at index 1 and so on, following this pattern until the end of the array. The steps of the CyclicSort algorithm are as follows: - Iterate through the list. - If the element at the current index is not at the correct position (i.e., value should be at index `value - 1`), swap it with the element at its correct position. - Repeat the above step until the entire array is sorted.

For example, c2,3 represents the time taken for the \'bc\' sequence. Additionally, performing certain operations in isolation (not part of any pair) incurs a penalty. For each operation, they have identified pi — the penalty incurred for isolating the operations, where i is the 1-based index of the operation.

During the conference, Gina plans to address m different topics in m different sessions. Each topic is to be covered in exactly one session. Gina needs to decide the order in which she will address the topics — formally, she needs to choose a permutation of integers from 1 to m (we\'ll call this permutation r). r_j is the index of the topic Gina will address in the j-th session. For each topic (except exactly one), there exists a preparation topic (for the topic j, the preparation topic is s_j). Gina cannot address a topic before addressing its preparation topic first. There exists at least one valid order of sessions according to these preparation constraints. Additionally, Gina has l special session constraints (u_i, v_i) meaning that she knows the lecture on the v_i-th topic will be more useful for attendees if it is conducted immediately after the lecture on the u_i-th topic. Gina wants to satisfy the constraints on every such pair, that is, for every i in [1, l], there should exist some j in [1, m - 1] such that r_j = u_i and r_{j + 1} = v_i. Now Gina wants to determine if there exists an ordering of topics that satisfies all the constraints, and if at least one exists, find any of them.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to make the substring a palindrome by removing at most k characters. Input - The first line contains a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). - The second line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries. - Each of the next q lines contains three integers l, r, and k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; 0 ≤ k ≤ (r - l + 1)). Output - For each query, output \\"YES\\" (without quotes) if it is possible to make the substring from index l to r a palindrome by removing at most k characters. Otherwise, output \\"NO\\". Example Input: abccba 2 1 6 0 1 4 2 Output: YES YES Explanation For the first query, the substring is the entire string \\"abccba\\", which is already a palindrome. Hence, the output is \\"YES\\". For the second query, the substring is \\"abcc\\" which is not a palindrome. By removing the characters \'b\' and \'c\', we can transform \\"abcc\\" into \\"a\\", which is a palindrome.

The forest where Anna lives consists of a grid with m rows and n columns, each cell contains a certain amount of food.

An array `fuels` of length `n`, where `fuels[i]` is the fuel capacity of the `i-th` truck. 4. An array `distances` of length `m`, where `distances[j]` is the distance to the `j-th` destination. The function should output a single integer, the maximum number of destinations that can be served. # Example Input ```python n = 2 m = 3 fuels = [5, 10] distances = [4, 6, 8] ``` Output ```python 2 ``` Explanation In this example, the first truck can travel to the first destination (4 units away) but not the second (6 units away) or third (8 units away). The second truck can travel to both the first and the second destinations, but not the third one. Therefore, the maximum number of destinations that can be served is 2 (first and second destination). # Constraints - 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ fuels[i] ≤ 10^9 - 1 ≤ distances[j] ≤ 10^9 Make sure your solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input sizes.","solution":"def max_destinations(n, m, fuels, distances): Determine the maximum number of destinations that can be served without any truck running out of fuel.

A string is a valid IPv4 address if: - It contains exactly three dots (`.`). - Each of the four segments separated by dots can be converted into an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive), without leading zeros, except the integer `0` itself. For instance: - \\"192.168.0.1\\" is valid. - \\"256.256.256.256\\" is invalid because 256 is out of the valid range. - \\"1.1.1\\" is invalid because it has only three segments. - \\"123.045.067.089\\" is invalid because segments should not contain leading zeros.

Each location is connected by a direct road with a certain time to travel between them. Some locations may have limited visiting hours. The city administration has asked you to help plan the visit for attendees so they can collect the maximum number of stamps within a given period. You are given a list of locations and a list of roads. Each location has a unique identifier, a time window during which it is open, and an indicator of whether it provides a stamp or not. Each road has a travel time associated with it. Write a function that, given the time available to the attendee, determines the maximum number of stamps they can collect. You can assume that the attendee starts at the first location (`id 1`) at time `0`. The input format is as follows: - The first line contains two integers `n` (number of locations) and `m` (number of roads). - The next `n` lines describe each location with three values: `id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time` (opening and closing hours inclusive) and `stamp` (1 if the location provides a stamp, 0 otherwise). - The next `m` lines describe the roads with three values: `u`, `v`, and `travel_time` denoting a bidirectional road between `location u` and `location v` with the specified travel time. - The last line contains a single integer `T`, the total time available for the visit.

In this traversal method, the nodes are recursively visited in this order; Node -> Left subtree -> Right subtree. Now, consider a special type of binary tree where each node can have not only a left and a right child but also an arbitrary number of children in between. For this tree, we perform a special type of traversal which follows the preorder pattern but also includes these arbitrary children. The nodes are visited in the order – Node -> Left subtree -> Arbitrary children from left to right -> Right subtree.

Given the number of students in the university, the number of departments, and the number of desired top teams, find out the minimum number of collaborations Arkady needs to ensure the desired number of top teams can participate. The input format is as follows: - The first line contains three integers `n`, `d`, and `t` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d, t ≤ n) — the total number of students, the number of departments, and the number of desired top teams. - The second line contains `n` different integers `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n` (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 100), where `s_i` denotes the score of the `i`-th student. - The third line contains `n` integers `d_1, d_2, ..., d_n` (1 ≤ d_i ≤ d), where `d_i` denotes the department the `i`-th student belongs to. - The fourth line contains `t` different integers `t_1, t_2, ..., t_t` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) — the IDs of the desired top teams (where each ID is an index of a student).

The heights are defined such that the width of each building is 1 unit. The water that can be trapped between two buildings is determined by the shorter of the two heights, as water cannot spill over the shorter building. You need to sum up the water trapped for all possible pairs of buildings. Write a function `trap_rain_water(heights: List[int]) -> int` that takes an array of integers `heights` where each integer represents the height of a building, and returns an integer indicating the total amount of water that can be trapped. For example, given the input array `[4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]`, the output should be `9`. Explanation: - Between buildings at index 0 and index 1, no water can be trapped because the height at index 1 (which is 2) is lower than the height of the next buildings (which are all higher). - Between buildings at index 1 and index 2, 2 units of water can be trapped (water level = 2, space between buildings = 2). - Between buildings at index 2 and index 3, 3 units of water can be trapped (water level = 3, space between buildings = 1). - Between buildings at index 3 and index 4, 1 unit of water can be trapped (water level = 2, space between buildings = 1). - Between buildings at index 4 and index 5, no water can be trapped because index 5 (height of 5) is taller than index 4 (height of 2). Thus, the total water trapped is 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 9.

Your task is to help Peter by writing a function that performs this operation. To avoid precision issues with floating-point arithmetic, all computations should use degrees rather than radians, and results should be precise to four decimal places. # Input The input consists of three space-separated values: - x (−10^3 ≤ x ≤ 10^3), representing the x-coordinate of the vector. - y (−10^3 ≤ y ≤ 10^3), representing the y-coordinate of the vector. - θ (0 ≤ θ < 360), representing the rotation angle in degrees. # Output The function should output the new coordinates of the rotated vector as two space-separated decimal numbers, each rounded to four decimal places. # Example Input ``` 1 0 90 ``` Output ``` 0.0000 1.0000 ``` Input ``` 1 1 45 ``` Output ``` 0.0000 1.4142 ``` # Explanation - In the first example, rotating the vector (1, 0) by 90 degrees counterclockwise results in the vector (0, 1). - In the second example, rotating the vector (1, 1) by 45 degrees counterclockwise results in the vector (0, √2). # Note The rotation of a vector (x,y) by an angle θ can be computed using the following formulas: - x\' = x * cos(θ) - y * sin(θ) - y\' = x * sin(θ) + y * cos(θ) Where θ is the rotation angle in degrees. Ensure your calculations are accurate to four decimal places.","solution":"import math def rotate_vector(x, y, theta): Rotates a vector (x, y) by theta degrees counterclockwise and returns the new coordinates.

Each cell in the grid can either be a building (denoted by 1) or an empty lot (denoted by 0). The roads in this city are aligned with the boundaries of the cells, meaning that you can move from one cell to an adjacent cell if this cell is an empty lot. Cars can travel along the roads, but they cannot enter any cells containing a building. The city’s grid is surrounded by roads on all four edges. Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps needed for a car to get from a starting position to a destination position within the city map. You can assume that there will always be a valid path from the starting position to the destination. The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the number of rows and columns in the city grid. Each of the following n lines contains m integers describing the city grid, where each integer is either 0 or 1.

Each flower pot can hold a certain amount of water before it overflows. Petya wants to water the pots from left to right using a garden hose, but the hose has a peculiar behavior: it can water exactly k consecutive flower pots in one go, no more no less. After watering the k pots, the hose needs to be turned off and on again to resume watering. Petya can start watering from any pot and once he starts, he must water exactly k pots moving in the forward direction. If any given flower pot already has enough water and it gets watered again, it will overflow and the water will be wasted. Petya wants to minimize the total amount of wasted water after he finishes watering the pots. Given an array `a` of size `n` where `a[i]` indicates the amount of water each flower pot can hold and an integer `k` indicating the number of consecutive pots that will be watered at each step, help Petya find the minimum amount of wasted water. Input: - The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of flower pots. - The second line contains n non-negative integers representing the maximum water capacity of each flower pot, where each value is at least 0 and not more than 1000. - The third line contains a positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), the number of consecutive pots watered by the garden hose in each step. Output: - Print a single integer, the minimum amount of wasted water Petya will have after watering the flower pots. Example: ``` Input: 6 3 2 5 4 3 2 3 Output: 2 ``` Explanation: Petya can start watering from the first pot to get [3, 2, 5], no overflow here. Then he waters from the fourth pot to get [4, 3, 2], again no overflow. Thus, the total wasted water is 0. Alternatively, if he starts from third pot and waters 3 pots, the sequence [5, 4, 3] will be watered from there, no overflow. Optionally start from first pot to water next 3, [3, 2, 5]. He can choose various beginning points but must limit 3 pots to be watered.
