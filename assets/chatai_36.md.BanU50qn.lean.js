The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or populated or unpopulated. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. # Rules At each step in time, the following transitions occur: 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. # Task You are required to implement a function `game_of_life(board)` to simulate the Game of Life. The function takes a 2D list (list of lists) representing the initial state of the board, where 1 represents a live cell and 0 represents a dead cell.

The cross-entropy loss is commonly used in classification problems where the task is to assign an input to one of several classes. Your function, `compute_cross_entropy_loss`, should take two inputs: 1. `Y_hat`: A numpy array containing the predicted probabilities for each class. It has shape (num_classes, m), where `num_classes` is the number of classes and `m` is the number of examples. 2. `Y`: A numpy array containing the true labels. It has shape (num_classes, m), where `num_classes` is the number of classes and `m` is the number of examples. The true labels are represented as a one-hot encoded matrix, where each column corresponds to an example and contains a single `1` at the index of the true class and `0`s elsewhere. Your function should return: - `loss`: A scalar representing the cross-entropy loss, computed as the negative log-likelihood of the true labels given the predicted probabilities. To complete this task, you need to follow these steps: 1. Compute the negative log-likelihood using the formula for cross-entropy loss: [ text{loss} = - frac{1}{m} sum_{i=1}^{m} sum_{j=1}^{num_classes} Y_{j,i} log(Y_hat_{j,i}) ] 2. Use `numpy.log()` to compute the natural logarithm. 3. Use `numpy.sum()` for summing the terms in the loss computation.

If the requested withdrawal amount is more than the current balance, do not change the balance and print an appropriate message. 4. Implement a method `check_balance()` which returns the current balance of the account. The user\'s interaction with this simulated bank account should be done using an interface function named `bank_operations` that continuously prompts the user to choose one of the three operations until they decide to exit the program.

The function will be named `format_name`. **Function Name:** `format_name` **Function Input:** - `full_name`: A string representing the full name of a person that might include prefixes like \'Dr.\', \'Mr.\', \'Mrs.\', \'Ms.\', followed by their first and last name.

Use the `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` function to create the plot. 2. Use the `matplotlib.pyplot.show` function to display the plot. The function should perform the following steps: - Calculate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and store them in a list `fib`. - Generate a list `x` containing integer values from 1 to 10 (positions of Fibonacci numbers). - Use the `plot()` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module to create a line plot. - Plot `x` versus `fib`. - Use a suitable marker (e.g., \'o\') for each point on the line. - Show the plot using the `show()` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. **Function Signature**: ```python def plot_fibonacci(): pass ``` **Example**: When you run the `plot_fibonacci()` function, it should display a plot where: - The x-axis represents the positions (1 through 10). - The y-axis represents the Fibonacci numbers at these positions. **Additional Instructions**: - Import required functions from the Matplotlib library. - Add labels and title to the plot for better clarity. - Ensure the plot is visually appealing and correctly formatted. **Parameters and Returns**: - The `plot_fibonacci()` function does not take any parameters and does not return any values.","solution":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def plot_fibonacci(): Generates the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence and plots these values using Matplotlib. fib = [0, 1] for i in range(2, 10): fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2]) x = list(range(1, 11)) plt.plot(x, fib, marker=\'o\', linestyle=\'-\', color=\'b\') plt.title(\'Fibonacci Sequence\') plt.xlabel(\'Position\') plt.ylabel(\'Fibonacci Number\') plt.grid(True) plt.show()"},{"question":"You are required to write a function `find_largest_rectangle(histogram: list) -> int`.
