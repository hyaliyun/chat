The answer should be given modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). **Example:** **Input:** \`\`\` 4 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 \`\`\` **Output:** \`\`\` 0 0 0 1 \`\`\` **Explanation:** - After adding the first corridor between labs 1 and 2, no loop can be formed. - Adding the second corridor between labs 2 and 3 still doesn't form any loop. - Adding the third corridor between labs 3 and 4 doesn't create a loop either. - Adding the fourth corridor between labs 4 and 1 creates a loop 1-2-3-4-1.

The town had a long, straight road where stalls were set up, each run by different vendors selling their unique items. Little Johnny is at the entrance of this road and wishes to buy his favorite items from specific stalls. Johnny has a list of items he wants to buy and the locations (measured by the distance from the entrance of the road) of the stalls that sell these items. Johnny wants to minimize the total distance he travels. He can only move forward along the road, meaning once he visits a stall, he cannot go back to a previous one. Help Johnny by writing a program to determine the minimum total distance he must travel to buy all his favorite items. -----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of items Johnny wishes to buy. The second line contains n integers, a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the distances of the stalls selling these items in non-decreasing order. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum total distance Johnny has to travel to buy all his items. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 5 9 Output 8 Input 5 2 3 6 8 10 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first test case, Johnny starts at the entrance (position 0), buys the first item at position 1, then he has to travel to position 5 (total distance 5 - 1 = 4), and finally to position 9 (total distance 9 - 5 = 4). The total minimum distance is 1 + 4 + 4 = 8. In the second test case, Johnny starts at the entrance and goes to position 2 (total distance 2), then to position 3 (total distance 1), then to position 6 (total distance 3), then position 8 (total distance 2), and finally position 10 (total distance 2).

To resolve this, you need to redistribute the students to ensure that no two students have the same seat number while keeping them as close as possible to their originally allocated seats.

Each task is represented by an integer ID (starting from 0) and the dependencies are represented as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'b' must be completed before 'a'.

However, some employees have started gossiping, and it is crucial to find out how fast the gossip can spread through the entire company. The speed of gossip spread is defined by the minimal number of message-passing rounds required for a message started by any single employee to reach all other employees in the company. Given the number of employees and the sequence of message sends, your task is to determine the minimum number of rounds required for any single starting point of gossip to reach everyone. -----Input:----- - The first line contains an integer N, the number of employees in the company. - The second line contains N integers, where the ith integer indicates the employee (1-indexed) to whom the ith employee sends a message. -----Output:----- Print a single line denoting the minimum number of rounds required for any gossip started by a single employee to spread to all other employees. -----Constraints----- - 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - Each employee sends a message to exactly one other employee in a circular manner (forming one complete cycle). -----Sample Input1:----- 5 2 3 4 5 1 -----Sample Output1:----- 5 -----Sample Input2:----- 6 2 1 4 5 6 3 -----Sample Output2:----- 6 -----EXPLANATION:----- In the first sample, every employee passes the message to the next in sequence: 1→2→3→4→5→1 (this forms a single cycle of 5 people). No matter who starts, it takes exactly 5 rounds for the message to loop back to the first sender and reach every other employee in the company. In the second sample, the cycle is: 1→2→1 and 3→4→5→6→3. Though there are two separate cycles, the gossip from any employee in one cycle will take 6 rounds to reach all because it needs to pass through all 6 employees, despite forming two smaller cycles.","solution":"def minimum_rounds_to_spread_gossip(N, message_sequence): Find the minimum number of rounds required for any single starting point of gossip to reach everyone in the company.

The rules for converting words into Pig Latin are as follows: 1. If a word begins with a consonant, move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and add \\"ay\\" to it. For example: - \\"happy\\" becomes \\"appyhay\\" - \\"glove\\" becomes \\"oveglay\\" 2. If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), simply add \\"way\\" to the end of the word. For example: - \\"apple\\" becomes \\"appleway\\" - \\"orange\\" becomes \\"orangeway\\" 3. For the purposes of this function, treat 'y' as a consonant.

Since programmers might work on several projects, a programmer can also be moved to a different room when they switch to another project.

The participants have different skills calculated as \`s_j\` for each participant \`j\`. The participants’ skill levels are also all unique. Alex wants to ensure that each participant can handle the difficulty of the problem given to them, and also wants the differences between a participant's skill and the problem's difficulty to be pairwise distinct. That is, if the j-th participant is given the i-th problem, the differences \`|s_j - d_i|\` should be pairwise distinct for all participants. Given the difficulty levels of the problems and the skill levels of the participants, determine an assignment of problems to participants such that the differences are all unique. For example, if the skill levels are \`s = [4, 10, 12]\` and the difficulty levels are \`d = [8, 2, 5]\`, one possible valid assignment could be: Assign the problem with difficulty 5 to the first participant, the problem with difficulty 2 to the second participant and the problem with difficulty 8 to the third participant. The differences will be 1, 8, and 4 respectively, which are distinct. Meanwhile, an invalid assignment would be: Give the problem with difficulty 8 to the first participant, the problem with difficulty 2 to the second participant, and the problem with difficulty 5 to the third participant. The differences will be 4, 8, and 7 respectively. This is invalid because the pairwise differences (4, 8, 7) are not unique. -----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases.

The power of each card is represented by a positive integer. You own some cards, and you can use them to battle against your opponent. Each battle consists of two parts: choosing a subset of your cards to play and determining the total power of your chosen subset. You win a battle if the total power of your chosen subset is strictly greater than the total power of the subset chosen by your opponent. Given the powers of your cards, you want to maximize your chances of winning by ensuring that you can always choose a subset of your cards with a unique total power. To achieve this, you need to modify the power of some of your cards so that no two subsets you choose have the same total power.
