The prefix sum of an array is a new array where each element at index (i) is the sum of all elements from the original array from index (0) to (i). However, Alyssa\'s array can be very large, which makes it inefficient to always calculate the prefix sum from scratch. Therefore, she wants to calculate the prefix sums efficiently for multiple queries. Task Write a program to compute the prefix sums from a given array and answer multiple queries. Each query will ask for the prefix sum up to a certain index.

The pipelines are bidirectional and have distinct integer lengths. The king of DataVille wishes to determine if it\'s possible to redraw the map of DataVille such that the pipeline lengths conform to a given set of constraints.

One common operation is to merge a series of layers together into a single image. The merging process involves combining the pixel values of each layer in a specific order, usually by a given set of pairwise operations. Each layer is represented as a matrix of integers, where each integer represents the brightness of a pixel. Consider a scenario where you have N layers, each of size M times M , and you need to perform a series of K merge operations on these layers. Each merge operation specifies two layers A and B , where the resultant merged layer will have each pixel value as the maximum of the corresponding pixels from layers A and B . The original layer A is then replaced with this merged layer A , and layer B remains unchanged. You are required to write a program that simulates these merge operations and answers queries about the pixel values in specified layers after all merges are done.

The stadium has a straightforward layout: it consists of n horizontal lanes, each having the same width but differing lengths. The cars will start at the west end of the lanes and race towards the east. Some lanes may have obstacles which the cars must avoid. Each obstacle blocks a specific range of the lane, making that part impassable. Cars must navigate around these obstacles. Given the list of obstacles for each lane, your task is to determine the minimum distance a car must travel in lane k to reach the eastern end of the lane, avoiding all obstacles. The car can only switch lanes at the start of the race. Input The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) – the number of lanes and the number of obstacles, respectively. The second line contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) – the lane number we are specifically interested in. The next n lines each contain an integer l_i (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9) – the length of lane i. Then, m lines follow. Each of these contains three space-separated integers x, y, z (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 0 ≤ y < z ≤ l_x) indicating an obstacle in lane x which blocks the segment from y to z. Output Print a single integer which is the minimum distance a car needs to travel in lane k to reach its end, avoiding all obstacles. If the car cannot reach the end of the lane, print -1.

Their lengths are 100, 200, and 150 respectively. - Lane 1 has obstacles between 10-30 and 20-40. - Lane 2 has obstacles between 50-70 and 60-80. - Lane 3 has an obstacle between 75-120. We are interested in the second lane, which reaches its end at 200. The car can navigate around the obstacles in lane 2 with no extra distance by passing either before 50 or after 80. Hence, the minimum distance traveled remains 200.

The grid is initially empty. The commands consist of: * \'L x y\' - Place a light bulb at position (x, y). * \'T x y\' - Toggle the light bulb at position (x, y) (change it from on to off or vice versa). * \'Q x y\' - Query whether the light bulb at position (x, y) is on or off. Your task is to process these commands and determine the state of the light bulb immediately after each query command. Assume the grid can be infinitely large and initially all positions are off. Input The first line contains an integer n, the number of commands. Each of the next n lines contains a command in one of the formats described above. Output For each query command in the input, output \\"ON\\" if the light bulb at the queried position is on, and \\"OFF\\" otherwise. Examples Input 6 L 1 2 Q 1 2 T 1 2 Q 1 2 L 3 4 Q 3 4 Output ON OFF ON Explanation - The first command places a light bulb at position (1, 2). - The second command queries the status of the light bulb at position (1, 2), which is \\"ON\\". - The third command toggles the light bulb at position (1, 2) to \\"OFF\\". - The fourth command queries the status of the light bulb at position (1, 2), which is \\"OFF\\". - The fifth command places a light bulb at position (3, 4). - The sixth command queries the status of the light bulb at position (3, 4), which is \\"ON\\".","solution":"def process_commands(commands): Processes a list of commands on a grid and returns the state of light bulbs for each query command.

This question will test your knowledge of array manipulation and sliding window techniques. Let\'s denote the array as arr and its length as n. Your task is to find the maximum length of a subarray such that the sum of the subarray is ≤ S. Input: The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines: - The first line has two integers, n and S. - The second line has n space-separated integers, representing the array arr.

A word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where \\"adjacent\\" cells are those horizontally, vertically, or diagonally neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used multiple times. -----Input----- - The first line contains two integers `m` and `n` (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 200) denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. - The next `m` lines contain `n` characters each representing the grid. - The last line contains the word to be searched in the grid.
