The overall winner is the participant who has the lowest total ranking score. The ranking score for a participant is the sum of their position in each race (1st place = 1 point, 2nd place = 2 points, and so on). If two or more participants have the same ranking score, the participant who had the highest individual finishing position in any race should be considered the winner.

The elevator can only move one floor at a time, either up or down.

Your task is to determine the minimum expenditure required to collect all the coins from the first district to the last district. The player follows these rules: 1.

Your function findLargestSquare will take a single input, a 2D array (list of lists) representing the grid, and return the size (side length) of the largest square found. Your function should efficiently process grids of varying sizes, and the side length of the largest square is the only output required. If there are multiple squares with the same largest size, the function should still return the size of the square.

Use nested loops to iterate over the grid, updating your matrix based on the elements in the grid, and keep track of the maximum size found. The algorithm follows these steps: 1. Initialize a 2D array of the same dimensions as the grid to keep track of the largest square size ending at each cell. 2. Iterate through each cell in the grid, updating your 2D array based on whether the current cell is part of a square (i.e., if the adjacent cells form smaller squares that can be extended by one row and one column). 3.

Constraints: * Each weight is an integer. * The length of the weights list is between `1` and `20`. * Each weight is between `1` and `1000`.

Each Orb can be placed in a strategic position to maximize control over specific areas. Each Orb has a known power that allows it to influence a certain number of units in its vicinity. You are given a one-dimensional coordinate system where the position of each Orb is located at discrete points. An Orb located at position `P` with power `A` can influence all positions in the range `[P - A, P + A]`.

For example, if there are three Orbs located at positions `1`, `5`, and `10` with power values `1`, `3`, and `1` respectively, and the segment to be influenced is `[2, 9]`, you need to determine the smallest subset of Orbs that can collectively influence the entire segment from 2 to 9. -----Input format----- The first line contains two space-separated integers `N` and `M`, where `N` is the number of Orbs and `M` is the length of the segment to be influenced.
