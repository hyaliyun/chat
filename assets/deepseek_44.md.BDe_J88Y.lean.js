Your memory manager should be able to perform the following operations: 1. Allocate a memory block of a given size. 2. Free a previously allocated memory block. 3. Report the total allocated memory. The memory manager maintains a total memory pool, which you can assume is sufficiently large to handle all requests without running out of memory.

The streets are represented as directed edges and there may be multiple one-way streets connecting the same pair of intersections. Catherine has identified k critical intersections that should be monitored to ensure the shortest travel time from a starting intersection to a destination intersection does not exceed a given time limit. The travel time along each street is represented by an integer value and the total travel time is the sum of the travel times of all streets used in the path. Given p queries, each consisting of a start intersection s_i, a destination intersection d_i, and a time limit t_i, determine if there exists a path from s_i to d_i such that the travel time does not exceed t_i and includes at least one critical intersection. Input The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of intersections, the number of streets, and the number of critical intersections. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u_j, v_j, and w_j (1 ≤ u_j, v_j ≤ n, 1 ≤ w_j ≤ 10^5), representing a one-way street from intersection u_j to intersection v_j with travel time w_j. Each pair (u_j, v_j) is unique. The next line contains k integers representing the critical intersections. The next line contains p (1 ≤ p ≤ 10^5), the number of queries.

This system should understand the current status of the inventory, efficiently add new stock, and retrieve stock from the shelves as requested. Here’s how the inventory management should work: 1. The system will maintain a list of shelves, each of which can hold multiple products. 2. Each product has a unique SKU, a shelf number, and a quantity associated with it. 3. Operations to manage products include adding stock, retrieving stock for shipment, and querying the current inventory status. # Operations 1. Add Stock Add a specified quantity of a product to a shelf. 2. Retrieve Stock Retrieve a specified quantity of a product from a shelf for shipping. If there is not enough stock on the specified shelf, retrieve as much as possible from the shelf, and continue with other shelves if necessary, prioritizing shelves with lower numbers first. 3. Query Stock Query the current status of the inventory for a particular SKU or all SKUs. # Input/Output Format Input will be provided in the form of commands, each on a new line. Each command can be of the following types: - `ADD SKU ShelfNumber Quantity` - Adds a specific quantity of an SKU to the specified shelf. - `RETRIEVE SKU Quantity` - Retrieves the specified quantity of the SKU from the shelves. - `QUERY SKU` - Queries the total quantity and distribution of the SKU. - `QUERY ALL` - Queries the total quantity and distribution of all SKUs. - `END` - End of input, stop processing commands. For each `QUERY` command, output the current stock information in the format specified. # Constraints - The SKU consists of alphanumeric characters only. - ShelfNumber is an integer. - Quantity is a non-negative integer. - The number of shelves can be at most 100 and the number of distinct SKUs can be at most 1000. - The final output of any quantity should not exceed `10^9`. # Example Input ``` ADD A123 1 50 ADD A123 2 30 ADD B456 1 20 RETRIEVE A123 60 QUERY A123 QUERY ALL END ``` Output ``` A123 20 [Shelf 2: 20] ALL A123 20 [Shelf 2: 20] B456 20 [Shelf 1: 20] ``` The example above demonstrates the use of the inventory management system showing how products are added, retrieved, and queried for their current stock status.","solution":"class Inventory: def __init__(self): self.shelves = {} def add_stock(self, sku, shelf_number, quantity): if sku not in self.shelves: self.shelves[sku] = {} if shelf_number not in self.shelves[sku]: self.shelves[sku][shelf_number] = 0 self.shelves[sku][shelf_number] += quantity def retrieve_stock(self, sku, quantity): if sku not in self.shelves or quantity <= 0: return shelves = sorted(self.shelves[sku].items()) retrieved_qty = 0 for shelf, qty in shelves: if retrieved_qty >= quantity: break if qty > 0: if retrieved_qty + qty > quantity: self.shelves[sku][shelf] -= (quantity - retrieved_qty) retrieved_qty = quantity else: retrieved_qty += qty self.shelves[sku][shelf] = 0 def query_stock(self, sku=None): if sku is None: result = [\'ALL\'] skus = sorted(self.shelves.keys()) for s in skus: result.append(self._format_sku(s)) return \'n\'.join(result) else: return self._format_sku(sku) def _format_sku(self, sku): if sku not in self.shelves: return f\\"{sku} 0 []\\" total_qty = sum(self.shelves[sku].values()) shelf_dist = \', \'.join(f\\"Shelf {s}: {q}\\" for s, q in sorted(self.shelves[sku].items()) if q > 0) return f\\"{sku} {total_qty} [{shelf_dist}]\\" def process_commands(commands): inventory = Inventory() result = [] for command in commands: parts = command.split() if parts[0] == \\"ADD\\": sku = parts[1] shelf_number = int(parts[2]) quantity = int(parts[3]) inventory.add_stock(sku, shelf_number, quantity) elif parts[0] == \\"RETRIEVE\\": sku = parts[1] quantity = int(parts[2]) inventory.retrieve_stock(sku, quantity) elif parts[0] == \\"QUERY\\": if parts[1] == \\"ALL\\": result.append(inventory.query_stock()) else: sku = parts[1] result.append(inventory.query_stock(sku)) elif parts[0] == \\"END\\": break return result"},{"question":"Alyssa is trying to understand how strings can have different groups of unique characters.

This tree is special due to its unique structure and magical properties. The Magic Tree is a rooted binary tree where each node contains a certain amount of mana. The root of the tree is always at node 1. Mana can be propagated through the tree using a magical ritual. During this ritual, the mana from the parent node is equally distributed to its child nodes. If a node has only one child, it passes its mana entirely to that child. If a node has two children, it splits the mana equally between them.

Each widget needs to pass through a series of quality checks before it’s shipped. The factory tracks these widgets in a system that records their movements through various checkpoints. There are n widgets and m checkpoints. The factory recorded the movements of the widgets through the checkpoints as pairs of integers (a, b), meaning that widget a passed checkpoint b. Each widget can pass through multiple checkpoints, but no checkpoint will record the same widget more than once. Due to some system errors, the factory needs to identify the maximum number of widgets that passed through the same set of checkpoints.

Therefore, the total amount of water Peter needs to manually provide is 45 + 50 = 95 mm. - In the second test case, the total water requirement for the two plants each day is 5 + 5 = 10 mm. On day 1, 4 mm of rain is received, so Peter needs to add 10 - 4 = 6 mm. On day 2, 6 mm of rain is received, so Peter needs to add 10 - 6 = 4 mm. On day 3, 8 mm of rain is received, so Peter needs to add 10 - 8 = 2 mm.

The race is divided into N sections, and each runner completes one section. Each runner\'s speed is recorded in meters per second. The total time taken by the team is determined by the individual speeds and the distance of each section. Each section can be of different lengths, and your task is to calculate the total time taken for the team to complete the race. Task Given the lengths of each section of the track and the speed of each runner, compute the total time taken by the team to complete the relay race. Input The first line contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), the number of runners and sections in the relay race.

Recently, the king has decided to build a series of libraries across the kingdom to encourage literacy. Libraries can be built either within a town or a town can gain access to a library if there is a direct or indirect road connection to a town with a library. Each road has a maintenance cost, and each library also has a cost to build. You need to determine the minimum cost required to ensure that every town has access to at least one library.

The city planners have decided to upgrade the city\'s transportation system by creating a network of tram lines.

However, funding for this project is limited. The city can only afford to construct at most `k` tram lines. Additionally, they want to ensure that every intersection within the grid can be reached from every other intersection by using the tram network, even if it requires changing trams at certain intersections. Your task is to help the city planners by designing a tram network that meets these requirements.

This vending machine is special because, apart from dispensing items, it also supports promotions that provide a free item when certain conditions are met. Here are the unique characteristics of this vending machine: 1. The machine holds `n` different items, each with a unique price. 2. For each transaction, the user inputs the item they want to buy and the amount of money they\'re inserting. The machine will process the transaction based on the following rules: * If the inserted amount is exactly the price of the item, the item is dispensed. * If the inserted amount is more than the item\'s price, the machine will provide change and dispense the item. * If the inserted amount is less than the item\'s price, the machine will not dispense the item and notify the user with \\"insufficient funds\\". 3. There are two types of promotions: * Buy-One-Get-One-Free (BOGOF): If the user buys one item, they receive another identical item for free. * Add-X-More-To-Get-Free: If the user inserts at least X more than the item\'s price, they get the item for free (without deduction). Given these rules, you need to design and implement a program to simulate the vending machine. For each transaction, the program will output details about the transaction or notify the user if funds are insufficient. Input The input consists of several test cases, each on one line, as follows: item_price inserted_amount promo_type promo_value ... end Each test case consists of: * item_price: An integer representing the price of the item. * inserted_amount: An integer representing the amount of money inserted by the user. * promo_type: A string, either \\"none\\", \\"BOGOF\\", or \\"AddX\\". * promo_value: An integer representing the value associated with the promotion (if applicable). It will be 0 if no promotion is applied. If \\"promo_type\\" is \\"AddX\\", this value represents X. The input terminates with the string \\"end\\".

The network can be represented as an undirected graph where nodes represent servers, and edges represent direct connection links between these servers. Each edge has a weight indicating the data transfer speed between the connected servers. To continuously monitor the network\'s capacity for data transfers, Alice needs to find the critical link in the network. A critical link is the link that, if removed, would reduce the maximum possible data transfer speed between any pair of servers. In other words, the critical link is part of the maximum spanning tree of the graph and removing it would decrease the overall capacity of the network. Write a function `find_critical_link(n, graph)` that determines the weight of the critical link in the network. The graph is provided as a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) indicating a link between servers u and v with data transfer speed w. Servers are labeled from 1 to n. Input - `n`: an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of servers. - `graph`: a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v, w) contains two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the servers connected by a link and an integer w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing the data transfer speed of the link.

Each team is composed of several developers, and each developer has a unique productivity score. Your task is to arrange the teams in such a way that the least productive developers in the highest overall productivity teams are as high as possible in the sorted list. The challenge is simple but requires careful sorting strategies. Here\'s how you need to process the input and generate the output: Input The first line contains the number of teams t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). After that, each team description follows. Each team description starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of developers in the team. This is followed by n space-separated integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ 10,000) — the productivity scores of the developers in the team. Output Output the teams in sorted order. The teams should be sorted based on the minimum productivity score of each team (in ascending order). If two teams have the same minimum productivity score, they should maintain their relative order as described in the input.

These sequences are formed by a specific rule. Given an integer n, the sequence starts with the number 1, and each subsequent number is formed by adding 1 to the previous number and then appending it to the sequence. This process continues until the sequence reaches length n. For example, for n = 3, the sequence generation would be as follows: - Start with \\"1\\". - The next number is 1 + 1 = 2, so the sequence becomes \\"12\\". - The next number is 2 + 1 = 3, so the sequence becomes \\"123\\". For larger values of n, the complete sequence can be very long. To keep things manageable, you should output only the first 9 digits of the sequence when n is greater than 9. If n is less than or equal to 9, output the entire sequence. Input The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The system should be able to handle the creation of tables, insertion of records, and performing simple queries. The system has to process multiple commands given as text inputs. Each command will be either a table creation command, an insertion command, or a selection command. The table creation command creates a new table with a specified list of columns: ``` CREATE TABLE table_name (column1_name, column2_name, ..., columnN_name); ``` The insertion command inserts a new row into a specified table: ``` INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN); ``` The selection command retrieves all records from a specified table: ``` SELECT * FROM table_name; ``` Your task is to implement a program that can interpret and execute these commands. Assume that all table names and column names are unique, and values in the insertion commands match the expected types and number of columns of the specified table. # Input The input consists of multiple lines.

Each cell of the garden contains a certain number of flowers. The king wants to create special paths in the garden that satisfy certain conditions. A path is defined as a sequence of adjacent cells. Two cells are adjacent if they share a common edge. To meet the king\'s conditions, a path must satisfy the following: 1. The path must start from the top-left corner of the garden and end at the bottom-right corner of the garden. 2. Only rightward and downward moves are allowed. 3. The number of flowers in the cells along the path must form a strictly increasing sequence. Given the layout of the garden (the number of flowers in each cell), determine the length of the longest special path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the garden. Input The first line contains two integers m and n (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 50) — the dimensions of the garden. The next m lines contain n space-separated integers each, where the j-th integer in the i-th line represents the number of flowers in the cell at the i-th row and j-th column. The number of flowers in each cell is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Output Print a single integer — the length of the longest special path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the garden. Example Input 3 3 1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9 Output 5 Note In the example, one of the longest special paths is as follows: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9. The length of this path is 5.
