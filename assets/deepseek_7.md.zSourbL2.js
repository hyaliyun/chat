[5] because 5 is divisible by 5. 2. [5, 1, 2, 3, 4] because 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 15, and 15 is divisible by 5. 3. [1, 2, 3] because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 6 is divisible by 3. 4. [1, 2, 3, 4] because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and 10 is divisible by 5. In the second example, the array is [3, 6, 9, 12], and k is 3.

There are n employees and m tasks. Every employee is individually evaluated based on which tasks they can complete. Each employee has a list of tasks they have successfully completed before, and for each task, there is a score representing how well the employee did. Each employee also has a demand for a salary if included in the team. The goal is to select a subset of employees such that every task is covered by at least one employee and the total salary of the selected employees is minimized. An additional constraint is that each employee can only handle a maximum number of k tasks simultaneously. You are required to help the company determine the minimum total salary needed to form such a team that covers all tasks. # Input: - The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ m ≤ 20; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the number of employees, the number of tasks, and the maximum number of tasks an employee can simultaneously handle. - The following 2n lines describe the employees. Lines number 2i and (2i + 1) contain information about the i-th employee. The 2i-th line contains an integer si (1 ≤ si ≤ 109) — the salary demanded by the i-th employee. - The 2i-th line contains another integer pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ m) — the number of tasks the i-th employee has completed. - The (2i + 1)-th line contains pi pairs of integers.

The system needs to manage reservations of seats in a theater that has a specified number of rows and columns of seats. Each seat has a unique number assigned in a row-major order starting from 0 (top-left). There are three types of commands you need to implement for this system: reserve, cancel, and check. When you receive a reserve command, if the seat is available (i.e., not reserved), you should mark it reserved. If the seat is already reserved, do nothing. When you receive a cancel command, if the seat is reserved, you should mark it available. If the seat is already available, do nothing. When you receive a check command, you need to check if the seat is reserved or not and output the appropriate message. Input The input consists of one or more datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format: > R C > N > Command1 > Command2 > ... > CommandN R represents the number of rows (1 ≤ R ≤ 1,000) and C represents the number of columns (1 ≤ C ≤ 1,000) in the theater. N represents the number of commands to be executed (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000). Commandi is the i-th command to be executed. Each command consists of a command name and one or two arguments. The command name consists of only one letter and can be either \\"A\\", \\"C\\", or \\"Q\\". There is a space between the command and the argument or between the arguments. \\"A\\" represents a reserve command, with one argument S (0 ≤ S < R*C), which indicates the seat number to be reserved. \\"C\\" represents a cancel command, with one argument S (0 ≤ S < R*C), which indicates the seat number to be canceled. \\"Q\\" represents a check command, with one argument S (0 ≤ S < R*C), which indicates the seat number to be checked.
