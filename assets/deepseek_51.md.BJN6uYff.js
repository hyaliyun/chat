She came up with a new game where she shuffles a list of integers and then tries to permute the list such that no two adjacent elements in the permuted list have the same parity (i.e., one element should be odd and the other even). However, she quickly realized that it’s not always possible to achieve this permutation for every list. She has asked for your help to determine if it is possible to permute the list such that no two adjacent elements have the same parity, and if possible, to provide the permuted list. Your task is to write a program that reads multiple lists of integers and for each list, determines if such a permutation exists and provides the permutation if it does.

Write a function `characterSurvives` that takes two parameters: - An integer `initialHP` (1 ≤ initialHP ≤ 10^5) representing the initial health points of the character. - An array `hits` of integers (1 ≤ hits[i] ≤ 10^4) representing the sequence of hits the character receives. The function should return a string \\"SURVIVED\\" if the character\'s HP remains above zero after all hits have been applied, or \\"ELIMINATED\\" if the HP falls to zero or below. # Input The function `characterSurvives` takes the following inputs: 1. An integer `initialHP`. 2. An array of integers `hits` where each integer represents the damage from a hit. # Output Return a string \\"SURVIVED\\" if the character\'s HP remains above zero after all hits have been applied. Otherwise, return \\"ELIMINATED\\". # Example ```python characterSurvives(10, [3, 4, 2]) ``` Output: ``` \\"SURVIVED\\" ``` Explanation: The character\'s initial HP is 10. After the first hit, the HP is reduced to 7, then to 3 after the second hit, and finally to 1 after the last hit. The character has 1 HP left, so they survived. ```python characterSurvives(5, [4, 2]) ``` Output: ``` \\"ELIMINATED\\" ``` Explanation: The character\'s initial HP is 5. After the first hit, the HP is reduced to 1, and after the second hit, the HP is reduced to -1. The character\'s HP falls below zero, so they are eliminated. # Note The function must accurately compute the remaining HP after applying all hits in the given order and determine if the character survived or got eliminated.","solution":"def characterSurvives(initialHP, hits): Determines if a character survives after a sequence of hits.

During festive celebrations, you have to decorate buildings with lights. The cost of decorating a building is directly proportional to its height. You want to minimize the total cost of decorating the buildings. However, due to budget constraints, you can choose to reduce the height of exactly one building to zero. This may help in reducing the overall decoration cost. Write a function to find the minimum overall cost of decorating the buildings after reducing the height of exactly one building to zero. Input Format: - The first line contains an integer \'N\' representing the number of buildings. - The second line contains \'N\' space-separated integers which are the heights of the buildings. Output Format: - Output a single integer which is the minimum overall cost calculated after reducing the height of exactly one building to zero. Constraints: - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5 (1 ≤ i ≤ N) SAMPLE INPUT 5 10 20 30 40 50 SAMPLE OUTPUT 100 Explanation In this example, we have 5 buildings with heights [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. The total decoration cost without reducing any building is 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150. If we set the height of the first building to zero, the new heights will be [0, 20, 30, 40, 50], and the total cost will be 0 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 140. If we set the height of the second building to zero, the new heights will be [10, 0, 30, 40, 50], and the total cost will be 10 + 0 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 130. If we set the height of the third building to zero, the new heights will be [10, 20, 0, 40, 50], and the total cost will be 10 + 20 + 0 + 40 + 50 = 120. If we set the height of the fourth building to zero, the new heights will be [10, 20, 30, 0, 50], and the total cost will be 10 + 20 + 30 + 0 + 50 = 110. Finally, if we set the height of the last building to zero, the new heights will be [10, 20, 30, 40, 0], and the total cost will be 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 0 = 100. Therefore, by setting the height of the last building to zero, we get the minimum decoration cost, which is 100.","solution":"def min_decoration_cost(N, arr): Returns the minimum overall cost of decorating the buildings after reducing the height of exactly one building to zero. total_cost = sum(arr) return total_cost - max(arr)"},{"question":"The AtCoder Advent Calendar will commence soon and it involves a daily challenge spanning multiple days.

The clock will either be in normal mode or reverse mode for the entire duration of its operation. Given an initial time t_0 (0 ≤ t_0 < T) where the clock starts and a sequence of m operations, determine the final time displayed on the clock after completing all operations. Each operation is represented by a tuple (op, d), where op is either \'N\' for normal mode or \'R\' for reverse mode, and d is the duration of that operation in time units. In normal mode, the clock time increases by one unit per time unit, and it wraps around when reaching T. In reverse mode, the clock time decreases by one unit per time unit, and it also wraps around when reaching 0. Write a program to find and output the final time displayed on the clock after executing all operations. # Input - The first line contains three space-separated integers T, t_0, and m (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ t_0 < T, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). - The next m lines each contain a character and an integer representing an operation in the format \\"op d\\" (op ∈ {\'N\', \'R\'}, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9). # Output - Print the final time displayed on the clock after completing all operations. # Example Input ``` 100 10 3 N 5 R 20 N 15 ``` Output ``` 10 ``` Note In the example, the initial time is 10. The operations are as follows: 1. Normal mode for 5 units of time: (10 + 5) % 100 = 15 2. Reverse mode for 20 units of time: (15 - 20 + 100) % 100 = 95 3.

The friends have different preferences for the length of the path, and they prefer to maximize it. Given the dimensions of the board and the positions of some blocked cells that the path cannot pass through, determine the maximum possible length of a straight path that can be placed on the grid without entering any blocked cell. Input: The first line contains two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of the grid (n rows and m columns). The next line contains an integer `b`, representing the number of blocked cells. The following `b` lines each contain two integers `r` and `c`, representing the row and column indices of a blocked cell on the grid. Output: Output a single integer representing the maximum possible length of a straight path that can be placed on the grid. Example: Input: 5 5 3 2 2 3 3 4 4 Output: 5 Explanation: In the given example, the grid is 5x5 and three cells are blocked at (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4). The maximum possible straight path length is 5, which can be achieved in multiple ways, such as the entire first row or first column (both lengths being 5). Note: - The indices for rows and columns start from 1. - A straight path can be of length 1, covering just one cell if it cannot be extended further without encountering a blocked cell. This question tests the ability to navigate and evaluate paths in a grid, simulating various constraints and conditions typically encountered in grid-based problems.","solution":"def max_straight_path(n, m, blocked): # Create a grid initialized with True indicating all cells are initially free grid = [[True for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)] # Mark blocked cells as False for (r, c) in blocked: grid[r - 1][c - 1] = False max_length = 0 # Check for maximum path length in each row for i in range(n): current_length = 0 for j in range(m): if grid[i][j]: current_length += 1 max_length = max(max_length, current_length) else: current_length = 0 # Check for maximum path length in each column for j in range(m): current_length = 0 for i in range(n): if grid[i][j]: current_length += 1 max_length = max(max_length, current_length) else: current_length = 0 return max_length"},{"question":"You are given a list of integers and you need to answer a series of queries about subarray sums.

John wants to implement this backward stack and ensure all operations work perfectly. Can you help him by writing the code for the backward stack? Implement a class `BackwardStack` with the following methods: - `def __init__(self)`: Initializes the backward stack. - `def push(self, x: int) -> None`: Pushes the element `x` on top of the stack. - `def pop(self) -> int`: Removes and returns the element on top of the stack.

One important task is to ensure the consistency and correctness of transactions as they are processed in real time. In this task, you need to implement a system that can validate logs of transactions. A transaction log contains records of various types of financial transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Each record is timestamped and uniquely identified. For simplicity, we\'ll assume that transactions can be specified using the following format: - **D [timestamp] [transaction_id] [account_id] [amount]**: A deposit transaction - **W [timestamp] [transaction_id] [account_id] [amount]**: A withdrawal transaction - **T [timestamp] [transaction_id] [source_account_id] [destination_account_id] [amount]**: A transfer transaction Transactions should be processed in the order of their timestamps. Your task is to validate these transactions according to the following rules: 1. A deposit transaction should increase the balance of the specified account by the given amount. 2. A withdrawal transaction should decrease the balance of the specified account by the given amount. If the balance is insufficient, the transaction is invalid. 3. A transfer transaction should decrease the balance of the source account and increase the balance of the destination account by the given amount. If the source account balance is insufficient, the transaction is invalid. You will write a program that processes a list of transaction logs and prints the results of their validation.

Determine if it is possible for the king to collect and distribute all resources under the given rules, starting from the capital. If yes, provide one possible collection order of cities.

Limak can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) but cannot walk through flower patches. Limak starts from a designated starting position and can collect honey by reaching the beehive.

The string consists of alphanumeric characters and symbols indicating elements, quantities, reactants, and products. The equation follows the traditional format: `Reactants -> Products`, where each element is represented by its chemical symbol (e.g., H for Hydrogen, O for Oxygen), possibly followed by a numeric subscript indicating the number of atoms. The entire equation is a valid chemical equation and there are no parentheses. Your task is to parse the equation and determine the total number of atoms for each element on both the reactant and the product sides, and then check if the equation is balanced. An equation is considered balanced if for each element the total number of atoms on the reactant side is equal to the total number of atoms on the product side. Input A single string representing the chemical equation. The length of the string is between 1 and 1000. The string contains only valid chemical symbols, digits, spaces, the arrow symbol \'->\', and optionally +/- signs. The reactants and products are separated and the equation is properly formatted. Output Print \\"Balanced\\" if the chemical equation is balanced, otherwise print \\"Unbalanced\\". Example Input: `H2 + O2 -> H2O` Output: `Balanced` Input: `C2H6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O` Output: `Unbalanced` Note: 1. Chemical symbols in the string may contain one or two letters, with the first letter always being uppercase and the second letter (if present) always being lowercase. 2. Quantities of elements (if greater than 1) immediately follow their respective symbols. 3. Elements within a molecule are immediately adjacent (e.g., H2O represents two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). 4. Each molecule within a reactant or product is separated by a space, \'+\', or \'->\'.","solution":"import re from collections import defaultdict def parse_chemical_formula(formula: str): Parse a chemical formula into a dictionary of elements and their counts.

The locations are arranged in such a way that from every location, there exists exactly one path to any other location. Each year, precisely one of the following events might take place: 1. A new gate is constructed between two locations a and b. Moving directly from a to b through this gate increases the magical power of the traveler by a certain value p. 2. A wizard wants to travel from location x to location y and desires to accumulate the maximum possible magical power along the way. He requires help to determine the path that will give him the highest boost in magical power. Given the sequence of events, your task is to ensure that the wizard travels with the maximum magical power from his starting location to his destination every time event type 2 occurs. # Input The first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) — the number of locations. The next line contains an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000) — the number of events. Then follow `m` lines describing the events. Each event is represented either by: - `1 a b p` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^9) indicating a new gate with magical power `p` being constructed between locations `a` and `b`, or - `2 x y` (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y) where a wizard wants to travel from location `x` to location `y` and seeks the path with the maximum magical power. # Output For each event of the second type (travel query), print a single integer — the maximum magical power the wizard can accumulate by traveling from location `x` to location `y`. # Examples Input: ``` 4 5 1 1 2 10 1 2 3 20 1 3 4 30 2 1 4 2 1 3 ``` Output: ``` 60 30 ``` # Explanation In the first example: 1. A gate between location 1 and location 2 is constructed with a power of 10. 2. A gate between location 2 and location 3 is constructed with a power of 20. 3. A gate between location 3 and location 4 is constructed with a power of 30. For the query `2 1 4`, the wizard travels from location 1 to location 4 along the path 1→2→3→4, accumulating a total power of 10 + 20 + 30 = 60. For the query `2 1 3`, the wizard travels from location 1 to location 3 along the path 1→2→3, accumulating a total power of 10 + 20 = 30.","solution":"class MagicRoutes: def __init__(self): self.graph = {} def add_gate(self, a, b, p): if a not in self.graph: self.graph[a] = [] if b not in self.graph: self.graph[b] = [] self.graph[a].append((b, p)) self.graph[b].append((a, p)) def max_power_path(self, x, y): visited = set() def dfs(node, target, path_power): if node == target: return path_power visited.add(node) max_power = 0 for neighbor, power in self.graph.get(node, []): if neighbor not in visited: max_power = max(max_power, dfs(neighbor, target, path_power + power)) return max_power return dfs(x, y, 0) def process_events(n, events): magic_routes = MagicRoutes() results = [] for event in events: if event[0] == 1: _, a, b, p = event magic_routes.add_gate(a, b, p) elif event[0] == 2: _, x, y = event result = magic_routes.max_power_path(x, y) results.append(result) return results"}]'),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const s=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return s?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(s)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(s)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},C=["disabled"],P={key:0},R={key:1};function M(s,e,u,m,a,r){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>a.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,a.searchQuery]]),a.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>a.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(n(!0),i(w,null,_(r.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(p,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+l(a.searchQuery)+'".
