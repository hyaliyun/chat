Output * An integer representing the maximum profit achievable. Constraints * You may not perform multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before buying it again). * The function should be optimized for both time and space complexity. Example ```python >>> max_profit_multiple_transactions([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]) 7 >>> max_profit_multiple_transactions([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 4 >>> max_profit_multiple_transactions([7, 6, 4, 3, 1]) 0 >>> max_profit_multiple_transactions([3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]) 8 ``` Hint To solve this problem, consider iterating through the `prices` list and accumulate the difference between consecutive elements if the second price is higher than the first. This greedy approach ensures you capture all upward movements efficiently.","solution":"def max_profit_multiple_transactions(prices: list[int]) -> int: Calculate the maximum profit from multiple buy and sell transactions. :param prices: List of daily stock prices :return: Maximum profit achievable max_profit = 0 for i in range(1, len(prices)): # If the current price is greater than the previous price, we make a profit if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]: max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1] return max_profit"},{"question":"# Quadratic Equation Solver **Context**: You\'re developing a software tool that solves quadratic equations of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ).

The Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm is a powerful method for denoising, which computes the denoised pixel value by taking a weighted average of similar patches in the image. This method can effectively reduce noise while preserving details. Task You need to implement a simplified version of the Non-Local Means algorithm for denoising a single-channel (grayscale) image. Write a function `denoise_image` that takes the following inputs: 1. `noisy_image`: A grayscale image (2D NumPy array) to be denoised. 2. `patch_size`: Size of the square patch (integer). For instance, if `patch_size` is 3, the patch is `3x3`. 3. `search_window_size`: Size of the square search window (integer). The search window is centered at the pixel being denoised. 4. `h`: Filter strength for the algorithm. A higher `h` means more smoothing. The function should return a denoised 2D NumPy array of the same shape as `noisy_image`. Input - `noisy_image`: 2D NumPy array representing a grayscale image with pixel values between `0` and `1`. - `patch_size`: Integer greater than `1` representing the size of the patch. - `search_window_size`: Integer greater than `patch_size` representing the size of the search window. - `h`: Positive float value representing the filter strength. Output - 2D NumPy array of the same shape as `noisy_image`, representing the denoised image.

Additionally, you will need to write tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation. **Class Implementation**: Implement the class `KeyValueStore` with the following methods: 1. `set(key: str, value: Any) -> None`: Adds a key-value pair to the store. 2. `get(key: str) -> Optional[Any]`: Retrieves the value for a given key. If the key does not exist, return `None`. 3. `remove(key: str) -> None`: Removes a key-value pair from the store. If the key does not exist, do nothing. 4. `update(key: str, value: Any) -> None`: Updates the value for an existing key. If the key does not exist, raise a `KeyError`. **Testing Requirement**: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation. The tests should cover: 1. Adding new key-value pairs and retrieving them. 2. Updating existing key-value pairs and confirming the update. 3. Removing key-value pairs and ensuring they no longer exist. 4.

Your system should be able to add new orders, list all orders, and search for orders by customer name. **Task**: 1. **Order Class**: Define an `Order` class that can store the unique identifier, customer name, list of items, and the total price. 2. **Order Management**: Implement functionality to add new orders, list all orders, and search for orders by customer name. 3. **Input/Output**: Ensure proper interaction with the user to input new orders, list existing orders, and search for specific orders. **Constraints**: - Orders should be stored in memory (no need for database or file storage). - Each order should get a unique identifier starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each new order. - The system should be case-insensitive when searching for customer names. **Function Specifications**: ```python class Order: def __init__(self, id: int, customer_name: str, items: list) -> None: - id <type: int>: Unique identifier for the order - customer_name <type: str>: Name of the customer placing the order - items <type: list>: List of items where each item is a dictionary with \'name\' and \'price\' def calculate_total(self) -> None: Calculates the total price of the order based on the items. def add_order(orders: list, customer_name: str, items: list) -> None: - orders <type: list>: List of current orders - customer_name <type: str>: Name of the customer placing the order - items <type: list>: List of items where each item is a dictionary with \'name\' and \'price\' Adds a new order to the list with the next unique identifier and calculated total price. def list_orders(orders: list) -> None: - orders <type: list>: List of current orders Displays all orders with their details. def search_orders(orders: list, customer_name: str) -> list: - orders <type: list>: List of current orders - customer_name <type: str>: Name of the customer to search for Returns <type: list>: - List of orders matching the customer name. def main() -> None: - Initializes the order list - Provides interface to add orders, list orders, and search orders if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() ``` **Input Format**: * For adding orders: customer name followed by list of items, where each item is entered as name and price (separated by a comma). * For listing orders: a command to list all orders. * For searching orders: a customer name to search for orders placed by that customer. **Output Format**: * For each order: display the unique identifier, customer name, list of items (name and price), and the total price. * Appropriate messages for listing and searching functions. --- This new question requires a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming, list manipulation, string handling, and integrating user inputs, aligning well with the given style and complexity.","solution":"class Order: def __init__(self, id: int, customer_name: str, items: list) -> None: self.id = id self.customer_name = customer_name self.items = items self.total_price = 0 self.calculate_total() def calculate_total(self) -> None: self.total_price = sum(item[\'price\'] for item in self.items) def add_order(orders: list, customer_name: str, items: list) -> None: order_id = len(orders) + 1 new_order = Order(order_id, customer_name, items) orders.append(new_order) def list_orders(orders: list) -> None: if not orders: print(\\"No orders available.\\") return for order in orders: print(f\\"Order ID: {order.id}\\") print(f\\"Customer Name: {order.customer_name}\\") print(\\"Items:\\") for item in order.items: print(f\\"- {item[\'name\']}: {item[\'price\']:.2f}\\") print(f\\"Total Price: {order.total_price:.2f}\\") print(\\"------------------------------\\") def search_orders(orders: list, customer_name: str) -> list: return [order for order in orders if order.customer_name.lower() == customer_name.lower()] def main() -> None: orders = [] while True: command = input(\\"Enter a command (add/list/search/quit): \\").strip().lower() if command == \\"quit\\": break elif command == \\"add\\": customer_name = input(\\"Enter customer name: \\") items = [] while True: item_name = input(\\"Enter item name (or \'done\' to finish): \\") if item_name.strip().lower() == \'done\': break item_price = float(input(\\"Enter item price: \\")) items.append({\\"name\\": item_name, \\"price\\": item_price}) add_order(orders, customer_name, items) elif command == \\"list\\": list_orders(orders) elif command == \\"search\\": search_name = input(\\"Enter customer name to search: \\") matched_orders = search_orders(orders, search_name) if not matched_orders: print(\\"No orders found for this customer.\\") else: list_orders(matched_orders) else: print(\\"Invalid command.

Each line in the file contains four integers separated by commas, representing the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of a rectangle: x1, y1, x2, y2. Your task is to write a function `rectangles_contain_point(filename: str, point: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]` that takes the file name and a point as inputs and returns a list of rectangles (represented by their coordinates) that contain the given point. A point is considered to be inside a rectangle if it lies within or on the boundary of the rectangle. Function Signature ```python def rectangles_contain_point(filename: str, point: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]: pass ``` Input * `filename`: A string representing the path to the file containing the coordinates. * `point`: A tuple `(px, py)` representing the point to check. Output * `List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of a rectangle that contains the point. Example ```python # Assume \'rectangles.txt\' contains: # -10,-10,10,10 # 20,20,30,30 # -5,-5,5,5 point = (0, 0) rectangles_contain_point(\\"rectangles.txt\\", point) # Output: [(-10, -10, 10, 10), (-5, -5, 5, 5)] ``` Performance Requirements * Your solution should read and process the file efficiently. * It should handle the provided input size constraints within reasonable time and space limits.","solution":"from typing import List, Tuple def rectangles_contain_point(filename: str, point: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]: px, py = point rectangles = [] with open(filename, \'r\') as file: for line in file: x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, line.strip().split(\',\')) if x1 <= px <= x2 and y1 <= py <= y2: rectangles.append((x1, y1, x2, y2)) return rectangles"}]'),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const r=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return r?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(r)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(r)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},O={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],z={key:0},P={key:1};function D(r,e,l,p,s,a){const m=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),_(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>s.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,s.searchQuery]]),s.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>s.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",O,[(n(!0),i(b,null,v(a.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),w(m,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),a.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(s.searchQuery)+'".
