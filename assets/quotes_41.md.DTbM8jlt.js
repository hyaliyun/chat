One day, he challenges his courtiers with the following problem: There are n magic jars aligned in a row, numbered from 1 to n. Each jar i initially contains a_i units of a special elixir. The special property of these jars is that if you perform a spell on them, any two adjacent jars will swap their contents. Each time a spell is cast, you have to choose a pair of adjacent jars and swap their contents. The king will be happy if, after some number of spells, the amount of elixir in every jar becomes a perfect square. He commands you to determine the minimum number of spells required to achieve this.

He wants to ensure that all the routers in the network are functioning optimally and requests your assistance with an interesting problem. The data center network can be represented as a tree with N nodes, where each node represents a router. The routers are classified based on their signal strength into two types: Type A and Type B. Different types have different operational costs, which Jayden wants to minimize. Each router has a signal strength value associated with it. A Type A router\'s cost is proportional to its own signal strength value. In contrast, a Type B router\'s cost depends on both its and its direct children’s signal strength values. Specifically, the cost is calculated as the sum of its signal strength and those of its direct children. Jayden wants the total cost across the network to be minimized by selecting an optimal type for each router. For analysis, you need to determine the minimal possible total cost required to operate the entire network under optimal router type assignment. The information about the network is given in the following manner: - The number of routers N. - A list representing the parent-child relationships between routers. The root router has a parent of 0. - A list of integers representing the signal strengths of each router. Input The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) — the total number of routers. The second line contains N-1 integers, where the i-th integer represents the parent of the i+1-th router (routers are one-indexed and the root router is 1). The third line contains N integers, where the i-th integer represents the signal strength of the i-th router.

In the second example, every subset sum of coins will be unique.

Input The input consists of two lists: - The first list `logs` contains entries of employee logs in the format `[employee_id, project_id, hours]`, where `employee_id` is an integer (1 ≤ employee_id ≤ 100), `project_id` is an integer (1 ≤ project_id ≤ 50), and `hours` is a float (0 < hours ≤ 12) representing the number of hours worked by the employee on the project for the day. - The second list `employees` contains unique employee IDs. Output The function should output a dictionary where the keys are the employee IDs and the values are dictionaries. Each of these dictionaries should have project IDs as keys and the total hours worked on each project by that employee as values. Example Input logs: [ [1, 101, 3.5], [2, 102, 4.0], [1, 101, 2.5], [3, 103, 5.0], [2, 102, 3.0] ] employees: [1, 2, 3] Output { 1: {101: 6.0}, 2: {102: 7.0}, 3: {103: 5.0} } Explanation - Employee 1 worked a total of 6.0 hours on project 101 (3.5 + 2.5). - Employee 2 worked a total of 7.0 hours on project 102 (4.0 + 3.0). - Employee 3 worked a total of 5.0 hours on project 103.","solution":"def generate_report(logs, employees): Generates a report of total hours worked by each employee on each project.

Each day, sunlight will filter through the greenhouse from slot 1 to slot m. The sunlight exposure for each slot decreases as it moves from slot 1 to slot m. Specifically, the amount of sunlight at slot 1 is q and it decreases by 1 unit for each subsequent slot towards slot m. Therefore, the sunlight at slot 2 is q-1, at slot 3 is q-2, and so on. If the calculated amount of sunlight for a slot falls below zero, Ananda can assume it still gets zero sunlight. Ananda aims to place the plants in such a way that as many of them as possible receive at least their required amount of sunlight. You need to help her find this maximum number of plants that can meet their sunlight requirements. Input: - The first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^9) — the number of plants, the number of slots, and the initial sunlight at the first slot, respectively. - The second line contains n integers s1, s2, ..., sn (0 ≤ si ≤ q) — the sunlight requirements of the plants. Output: - Print a single integer — the maximum number of plants that can be placed such that they meet their minimum sunlight requirements. Example: Input 5 6 7 4 3 2 1 0 Output 5 Input 7 5 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 Output 5 Note: In the first example, Ananda can place all five plants in the first five slots (with sunlights 7, 6, 5, 4, 3) such that each receives at least their required amount of sunlight. In the second example, the sunlight at the first 5 slots are 10, 9, 8, 7, and 6 respectively. Therefore, it\'s possible to successfully place only the first 5 plants. The other two plants cannot be placed because their requirements (which are 4 and 3) can’t be met given the available slots.","solution":"def max_plants_with_sufficient_sunlight(n, m, q, s): Computes the maximum number of plants that can meet their minimum sunlight requirements.

Write a program to determine the number of distinct rankings for multiple sets of participants. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), which represents the number of participants in the race.

He is working on a specific type of encoding scheme where he needs to compress a message by removing as many consecutive identical characters as possible but still retaining at least one character from each sequence of identical characters. The goal is to minimize the length of the encoded message. For example: - The message \\"aaabbbcc\\" would be encoded as \\"abc\\". - The message \\"aabbcc\\" would also be encoded as \\"abc\\". However, Tyler has discovered that the compression algorithm fails on longer sequences and mixed characters. He decided to automate this process and have you implement this encoding scheme. Given a string message as input, you should return the shortest encoded string eliminating consecutive identical characters. **Function Signature:** ```python def compress_message(message: str) -> str: ``` # Input - `message`: a string containing only lowercase English letters (1 ≤ |message| ≤ 1000). # Output - Returns a string which is the compressed version of the input message. # Example ```python assert compress_message(\\"aaabbbcc\\") == \\"abc\\" assert compress_message(\\"aabbccddeeff\\") == \\"abcdef\\" assert compress_message(\\"a\\") == \\"a\\" assert compress_message(\\"aaaaa\\") == \\"a\\" assert compress_message(\\"abcd\\") == \\"abcd\\" ``` **Explanation:** 1.

Sarah wants to ensure that data packets arrive at their destination as quickly as possible, and she needs to minimize the maximum transmission time for any direct communication between two devices. She realized that certain communication channels can be chosen to connect directly to achieve this goal. Given the network of devices and transmission times, your task is to help Sarah determine which communication channels should be chosen to minimize the maximum transmission time between any pairs of directly connected devices. **Input** The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), where n is the number of devices, and m is the number of possible communication channels.

Your task is to determine the hidden array by using a specific query operation. You can perform queries in the form of `? i`, where `i` is an index (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and you will receive the sum of the elements in the subarray from index `i` to some index `k` (i ≤ k ≤ n). For example, if you query `? 3`, you will get the sum of the subarray starting from index `3` to index `k`. The value of `k` is chosen in such a way that the returned sum provides you with useful information to infer the hidden array.

Given a string `s`, you need to decide which characters to keep and in what order to form the smallest possible string. To form this string: 1. Every distinct character should appear at least once. 2. You should maintain the relative order of the first occurrences of the characters from the original string as much as possible, but you can skip some characters to get the smallest lexographical string.

However, the tournament organizers also want to identify the participant with the highest score in any given sub-segment of the corridor at any given time. Formally, you have to handle two types of queries: * 1 l r v: a spell is cast increasing the scores of participants from position l to position r (inclusive) by v. * 2 l r: you have to find the maximum score of any participant that is situated between positions l and r (inclusive).
