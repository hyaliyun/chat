Your task is to place security cameras on some vertices of the polygon such that each side of the polygon is monitored by at least one camera. A camera placed on a vertex can monitor its adjacent edges. Each camera has a unique id from 1 to n. You need to output all sets of vertices where cameras should be placed so that every side of the polygon is monitored.

They take turns removing elements from the array, where a turn consists of removing one element and splitting it into two new elements such that their sum equals the value of the removed element and their product is maximized. These new elements are then reinserted into the array. The game starts with Tom taking the first move. A player loses if they are unable to make a move on their turn (i.e., all elements in the array are prime numbers and cannot be split further). Your task is to determine the winner, assuming both players play optimally. Input: The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers in the array.

Tom can start by removing 10, which can be split into [5, 5] (as 5*5=25 is the maximum product). The array becomes [6,5,5]. Jerry then has to move. He could take 6 and split it into [3,3] making the array [3,3,5,5]. Tom now starts his turn and he can split either of the 5s, but since they maximize the product, he continues until Jerry is left in a position where he cannot move, causing Tom to win. Example case 2. The array consists of [7,8,9]. Tom could start by splitting 8 into [4,4], making the array [7,4,4,9]. Jerry now can take 9 and split it into [3,3,3], making the array [7,4,4,3,3,3].

Oliver has an array of length n initialized with zeros. He will then perform m operations of two types: 1. `+ x y`: Add y to the element at index x. 2. `? x`: Query the prefix sum up to and including index x.

The park is divided into several zones and each zone is interconnected with several other zones. Rangers have set up observation points in some zones to observe the wildlife and track the population of various species of animals. However, due to limited resources, they can only set up a maximum of K observation points. The rangers want to maximize the number of zones that can be monitored directly or indirectly (i.e., if a ranger is in a zone, they can monitor all zones directly connected to it). You are provided with the park\'s map in the form of an undirected graph, where nodes represent zones and edges represent direct paths between zones. Can you determine the maximum number of zones that can be monitored by setting up at most K observation points? **Input** 1. The first line contains two integers, N and E, where N is the number of zones and E is the number of direct paths between zones. 2. Each of the next E lines contains two integers u and v, which indicates that zone u and zone v are directly connected by a path. 3.

[Input] - The first line contains an integer `t` denoting the number of test cases. - For each test case: - The first line contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of cycles). - The second line contains `n` space-separated integers either 0 or 1, denoting the initial state of each house (0 if dark, 1 if lit). [Output] For each test case, output `n` space-separated integers denoting the state of the houses after `m` cycles.

They have noticed that many people post similar advertisements multiple times, which overcrowds the section. To prevent this, the editor needs a tool that checks for duplicate advertisements. Your task is to implement a function that will help the editor detect duplicate advertisements. The editor defines two advertisements as a duplicate if one is a rearrangement of the words in the other (not necessarily the same order). For simplicity, assume that the words are separated by a single space and case matters (i.e., \\"Word\\" and \\"word\\" are different). Write a function `detect_duplicates(ads: List[str]) -> List[int]` that takes a list of ads as input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is the smallest index of the ad in the input list that is a duplicate of the corresponding ad. If an ad is not a duplicate of any previous ad, return -1 for that ad. The index should be zero-based. # Input - A list of strings, `ads` (1 ≤ len(ads) ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ len(ad) ≤ 10^3 for each ad) — the advertisements posted in the magazine. # Output - A list of integers of the same length as `ads`.

Each dataset is given in the following format: n V E D u1 v1 w1 u2 v2 w2 :: uE vE wE fairy1_location fairy2_location :: fairyn_location - The first line gives the number of fairies n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of vertices V (1 ≤ V ≤ 100), the number of edges E (1 ≤ E ≤ 1,000), and the destination vertex D (1 ≤ D ≤ V). - The next E lines describe the pathways in the forest. Each pathway is defined by three integers, ui, vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ V), which denote the two endpoints of the pathway, and wi (1 ≤ wi ≤ 1,000), which is the travel time between ui and vi. - The final n lines denote the initial location of each fairy, where fairy_i_location denotes the initial vertex of the i-th fairy (1 ≤ fairy_i_location ≤ V). Output For each dataset, output n lines. Each line should contain the shortest travel time for the i-th fairy to travel from their initial location to the destination vertex D.

The seesaw consists of positions from -X to X (inclusive) where 0 represents the pivot point, negative numbers represent positions to the left of the pivot, and positive numbers represent positions to the right of the pivot. Each position can either be empty or hold a weight. The total torque on the seesaw is the sum of the products of each weight and its position. To balance the seesaw, the total torque must be zero. Given a list of weights placed at specific positions on the seesaw, determine the minimum number of moves required to balance the seesaw, where a move is defined as placing a weight on an empty position or moving a weight from one position to another. If it is not possible to balance the seesaw, return -1. For example, if there is a weight of 3 at position -2 and a weight of 1 at position 1 on a seesaw spanning from -2 to 2, the total torque is ( (3 * -2) + (1 * 1) = -6 + 1 = -5 ).

The challenge lies in the fact that the given numbers can be extremely large, possibly hundreds or thousands of digits long. Your task is to write a function `lexical_addition(a: str, b: str) -> str` that takes two non-negative integers in string format, adds them, and returns the result as a string.

Alice starts with a string and she can perform the following operation as many times as she wants: - She can reverse any substring (contiguous part of the string). She wonders if it is possible to make the entire string a palindrome by applying the above operation any number of times. Problem Given a string `s` of length `n`, determine if it is possible to make the string a palindrome by reversing some (possibly zero) substrings of it. Input The input consists of a single string `s` with a length `n`. Constraints * 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 * The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

At each step, she can break any existing piece of chocolate into two smaller pieces by making either a horizontal or vertical cut. Alice wants to find out the minimum number of breaks required to divide the chocolate bar into pieces such that each piece is a 1x1 square.

If the item already exists, increment its quantity by the provided amount. - \\"REMOVE <item_id> <quantity>\\": Removes the specified quantity of the item with the given item_id from the inventory. If the item\'s quantity falls to zero or below, it is removed from the inventory. - \\"QUERY\\": Prints the current inventory status including all item_id\'s and their corresponding quantities in alphabetical order of item_id. Write a program that processes a sequence of operations and outputs the results of the \\"QUERY\\" operations. Input: - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of operations to be processed. - Each of the next n lines contains an operation in one of the three formats described above. Output: - For each \\"QUERY\\" operation, print the current state of the inventory in alphabetical order of item_id, where each line contains an item_id and its quantity separated by a space. If the inventory is empty, print \\"EMPTY\\".

Tom can move to any of the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) as long as the cell is within the grid boundaries and is not an obstacle. The goal is to determine whether Tom can reach Jerry\'s starting position and catch him.

A line can be either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (45 degrees). Each line consists of consecutive cells that are either all horizontally connected, vertically connected, or diagonally connected. The players want to know the maximum number of treasures they can consecutively find in such a line. Your task is to write a program that determines the maximum number of treasures in any straight line. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the dimensions of the grid. The next n lines contain m characters each, either \'.\' or \'T\', representing the grid.

The second line contains N integers separated by spaces, where the i-th integer represents the quantity of the i-th book available in the library (1 ≤ quantity ≤ 100). 3.

The optimal way is to borrow 3 books of the first type and 2 books of the third type, allowing him to borrow 2 different books in total. Although he could borrow up to 3 books of the second type, it would only count as 1 different book, so borrowing from the first and third types gives a better result. # Constraints - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ quantity ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ L ≤ 100","solution":"def max_different_books(N, quantities, L): Determine the maximum number of different books Tom can borrow.

One of his favorite games involves popping balloons. There are n balloons in a row, each with a certain amount of air in it, represented by an integer value ai. Tom can pop any number of balloons in one move, but they must be contiguous. When Tom pops a balloon, the air from that balloon is added to his score. However, if the air from a balloon at the start of a contiguous segment is a negative value, the entire segment fails to contribute towards his score and his total remains unchanged after that move. Tom wants to maximize his score by choosing the best strategy to pop different segments of balloons. Your task is to help Tom determine the maximum score he can achieve. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) — the number of balloons. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (-10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the amount of air in each balloon.

He is also a massive fan of competitive coding and keeps practicing problems involving heaps. One day, he came across a unique problem where he needs to process queries on a list of integers using a min-heap. The challenge is intriguing, and he could not solve it completely; so, he needs your help to write an efficient program for processing the queries. Problem You are given a list of integers and a set of queries to process. Each query can be of two types: 1. \\"add x\\": Add the integer \'x\' to the current list. 2. \\"remove_min\\": Remove and return the minimum integer from the current list. If the list is empty, return \\"None\\". You are required to process all queries and output the necessary results for each \\"remove_min\\" query. Input The first line contains an integer \'n\' (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), which is the number of queries. The next \'n\' lines each contain a query of one of the two types mentioned above: - \\"add x\\" where \'x\' is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). - \\"remove_min\\". Output Output the results of \\"remove_min\\" queries in the order they are processed, each result on a new line. If the list is empty at the time of a \\"remove_min\\" query, output \\"None\\". Examples Input 6 add 5 add 3 remove_min add 7 remove_min remove_min Output 3 5 7 Input 4 remove_min add 10 remove_min remove_min Output None 10 None Explanation In the first example, the list of integers after each query: - \\"add 5\\": [5] - \\"add 3\\": [3, 5] (min-heap order) - \\"remove_min\\": 3 is removed, list now [5] - \\"add 7\\": [5, 7] - \\"remove_min\\": 5 is removed, list now [7] - \\"remove_min\\": 7 is removed, list is empty now In the second example, initially, the list is empty. The query \\"remove_min\\" returns \\"None\\". - \\"add 10\\": [10] - \\"remove_min\\": 10 is removed, list is empty now - \\"remove_min\\": returns \\"None\\" because the list is empty.","solution":"import heapq def process_queries(n, queries): min_heap = [] results = [] for query in queries: if query.startswith(\\"add\\"): _, x = query.split() heapq.heappush(min_heap, int(x)) elif query == \\"remove_min\\": if min_heap: results.append(heapq.heappop(min_heap)) else: results.append(\\"None\\") return results"},{"question":"You are given a string containing a sequence of digits.

Your task is to maintain a version history log for each user in a system. Each version of user data is represented by an integer. You have to implement a function to add new versions, retrieve the latest version, and retrieve the version at a particular timestamp. Implement a data structure that supports the following operations: 1. `addVersion(userId, version)`: Adds a new version for the given user. 2. `getVersion(userId)`: Returns the latest version of data for the given user. 3. `getVersionAtTime(userId, timestamp)`: Returns the version for the given user at the specified timestamp. Each userId is a positive integer, each version is an integer, and timestamp is a positive integer representing the order of version additions. The operations should be efficient to handle a large number of users and versions. Input The first line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of operations. Each of the next q lines represents an operation in one of the following formats: 1. `1 userId version`: Add a new version for the user with the given userId. 2. `2 userId`: Get the latest version of data for the given user. 3. `3 userId timestamp`: Get the version of data for the given user at the specified timestamp. Output For each operation of type 2 or 3, output the result on a new line. Example Input 6 1 1 100 1 2 200 2 1 1 1 150 3 1 1 3 2 1 Output 100 100 200 Note For the queries `getVersionAtTime(userId, timestamp)`, it is guaranteed that the timestamp always corresponds to a valid version addition time for the given userId.","solution":"class VersionHistoryLog: def __init__(self): self.user_versions = {} def addVersion(self, userId, version): if userId not in self.user_versions: self.user_versions[userId] = [] self.user_versions[userId].append(version) def getVersion(self, userId): if userId in self.user_versions and self.user_versions[userId]: return self.user_versions[userId][-1] return None def getVersionAtTime(self, userId, timestamp): if userId in self.user_versions and 0 <= timestamp-1 < len(self.user_versions[userId]): return self.user_versions[userId][timestamp-1] return None"},{"question":"A programming academy wants to create a leaderboard that ranks students based on their cumulative test scores across multiple exams. The leaderboard should display students in descending order of their total score. In case of a tie in total score, students should appear in ascending order of their student IDs. Given the number of students and their scores in each test, write a program to generate the leaderboard. Input: - First line contains two integers N and M where N is the number of students and M is the number of exams. - Next N lines contain M integers each, representing the scores of a student in each exam. - Each of these N lines starts with an integer representing the `student_id` followed by M integers representing their scores.
