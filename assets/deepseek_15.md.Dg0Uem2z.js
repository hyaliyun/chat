Example 1: Input: coolness = [10, 3, 20, 7, 15] N = 5, M = 3 Output: 7 Explanation: By selecting the books with coolness scores [3, 10, 7], we get the subset [3, 7, 10] which gives us a difference of 10 - 3 = 7. This is the best possible subset with the minimum difference. Example 2: Input: coolness = [8, 2, 5, 9, 1, 7] N = 6, M = 4 Output: 4 Explanation: By selecting the books with coolness scores [2, 5, 7, 8], we get the subset [2, 5, 7, 8] which gives us a difference of 8 - 4 = 4. This is the best possible subset with the minimum difference. Your Task: This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function minDifference() that takes the size of an array (N), the array of coolness scores and the integer M and returns an integer representing the minimum possible coolness difference between the selected subset of M books.

Each alleyway links two different intersections, and no two alleyways connect the same pair of intersections. A special event occurs in this town called \\"Festival of Paths\\". During this event, all residents and visitors enjoy finding unique paths through the town while avoiding revisiting any intersection. We define a unique path as a sequence of intersections t1, t2, ..., tp, such that: * t1 is the start intersection * tp is the end intersection * for any i (1 ≤ i < p), intersections ti and ti + 1 are connected by an alleyway * no intersection is revisited in the path Your task is to calculate the number of unique paths between given pairs of intersections during the \\"Festival of Paths\\".

It is guaranteed that any two intersections are connected by no more than one alleyway, and there exists a unique path between any two intersections in the given input.

The library follows a strict policy that a book can be checked out if and only if it is currently available (i.e., it was previously checked in). To implement this logic, you need to create a small library system to track the records of books that get checked out and checked in. Given a series of events in chronological order, determine the final status of each book in the library. Each event is either: 1. \\"CheckIn <book_id>\\" - indicating that a book with ID <book_id> has been checked in. 2. \\"CheckOut <book_id>\\" - indicating that a book with ID <book_id> has been checked out.

He has been tasked with optimizing the traffic flow in a newly built city consisting of several intersecting one-way streets. The goal is to ensure that there are no traffic loops allowing cars to get stuck endlessly. In the city, the streets are represented as a set of directed graphs where intersections are nodes and one-way streets are directed edges. Mike needs to identify all possible sets of directed edges that, if removed, would eliminate all cycles in the city’s street network and leave the rest of the street system as connected as possible. Write a function `find_edges_to_remove` that takes in an integer `n` (number of intersections) and a list of tuples representing the directed edges between the intersections. Each tuple `(u, v)` in the list represents a one-way street from intersection `u` to intersection `v`. The function should return a set of edges that need to be removed to break all cycles.

Example 2: Input: N = 4, H = 90 P = {20, 20, 20, 20} Output: 5 Explanation: Even though N is 4 and each day John can climb 20 meters at most, the total height climbed in 4 days will be 80 meters, which is less than required height H (90). John needs at least 5 days to climb 100 meters if he can extend his training period. Your Task: You do not need to read input or print anything.

The discount percentage is applied based on the number of months subscribed in a block. For example, a 6-month subscription might have a 5% discount, and a 12-month subscription might have a 10% discount. Each subscription plan has its base monthly cost, and you are given the discounted prices for various subscription blocks. Your task is to determine which subscription plan offers the lowest effective monthly cost after discounts are applied. -----Input----- The first line contains an integer T (1 le T le 10), the number of subscription plans. Each subscription plan starts with a line containing an integer C (1 le C le 1000), the base monthly cost in dollars.

For a 6-month subscription block with a 5% discount, the total cost would be 6 times 100 times 0.95 = 570, hence 570/6 = 95 dollars monthly. For a 12-month block with a 10% discount, the total cost would be 12 times 100 times 0.90 = 1080, hence 1080/12 = 90 dollars monthly.

The city consists of n sectors, each having a certain number of resource units associated with it. The resource units of the i-th sector are denoted by r_{i}. Managing these resources is crucial for the city\'s survival. The central resource management uses a unique way of calculating the overall resource score for the city. Every possible non-empty subset of sectors is considered. For each subset, the sum of the resource units of that subset is calculated. Then, the maximum sum among all possible subsets is taken as the overall resource score for the city. The resource units of each sector can change over time due to various factors. Precisely, there will be q changes, each of the form i x indicating that r_{i} is updated to x. You need to find the resource score of the city initially and after each of the q updates. The resource score should be found by modulo 10^{9}+7. Formally, let M = 10^{9} + 7. If the score can be expressed as an integer S, output S % M.

An order request is fulfilled fully if it is met exactly with the quantity demanded, and partially if it is met with any quantity less than demanded (but greater than zero). You need to write a program that takes the inventory and order requests as input and determines the maximum number of order requests that can be fully or partially fulfilled. Input - The first line contains two integers M and Q, indicating the number of items in the inventory and the number of different product categories. - The second line contains M integers where the i-th integer represents the product category of the i-th item. - The third line contains an integer R, indicating the number of order requests. - Each of the next R lines contains two integers Ci and Qi, where Ci is the product category and Qi is the quantity demanded for that order request. Output - Output a single integer representing the maximum number of order requests that can be fully or partially fulfilled.

The project will last for n days, and on each of these days, a certain number of data samples will be collected. The data collection process is resource-intensive, so it is restricted by several constraints: 1. On some days, certain maintenance activities prevent any data from being collected. These days are marked as maintenance days. 2. The number of data samples collected on any single day cannot exceed k_1. 3. The number of data samples collected over any two consecutive days cannot exceed k_2. Given these constraints, your task is to find the maximum total number of data samples that can be collected during the project period. Formally, find the maximum integer m such that it is possible to choose n non-negative integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (where d_i is the number of data samples collected on day i) so that: * d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n = m; * for each maintenance day d, d_d = 0; * for each day i, d_i ≤ k_1; * for each pair of consecutive days (i, i + 1), d_i + d_{i + 1} ≤ k_2.

This file system supports operations for creating directories, creating files, and listing the contents of a directory. # Operations: 1. `mkdir path`: Create a directory at the given `path`. If intermediary directories do not exist, they should be created. 2. `create path content`: Create a file at the given `path` with the provided `content`. All intermediary directories should be created if they do not already exist. 3. `ls path`: List the contents of the directory at the given `path`. The listing should be done in alphabetical order.

The encryption mechanism works as follows: given a string `s` of length `n`, she needs to transform it into another string `t` using a list of operations defined below: Julia can perform operations of two types to any two adjacent characters with indices i and i+1, where 1 le i < n: 1. Swap the characters s_i and s_{i+1}. 2. Replace the character s_i with a new character. To avoid detection, the total number of operations Julia performs must not exceed 2 times 10^4. Julia wants you to develop a strategy to transform the initial string `s` into the desired string `t`. -----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `k` (1 le k le 10). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 le n le 1000), which is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. The second line of each test case contains the string `s`. The third line of each test case contains the target string `t`. -----Output----- For each test case print the answer in the following format: The first line of output must contain the total number of operations `m`, which the strategy will perform. Note that you do not have to minimize `m`. The inequality `m le 20000 must be satisfied. Each of the next `m` lines must contain operations formatted as “type i”, where “type” is equal to “1” if the strategy needs to perform a swap operation or “2 x” if the strategy needs to perform a replacement operation where `x` is the new character to replace.

The librarian has a structured system where books are placed on shelves in increasing order of their height. Each shelf can hold books up to a certain maximum height, and once a shelf reaches its height capacity, no more books can be added to it. The librarian wants to automate the process of placing books on the shelves, so your task is to write a program that helps in arranging the books appropriately. The library has `n` shelves, each with a specific maximum height capacity. You are given the maximum heights of the shelves in the form of an array `shelves`. Additionally, you have `m` books and you know the height of each book provided in an array `books`. The intent is to place each book on the first shelf from the left where it fits in height wise.

These vendors sell k different types of items. Each vendor carries a subset of these items. A buyer wishes to collect all k items by visiting as few vendors as possible. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of vendors, the buyer aims to minimize the total travel distance. The buyer can start at any position and needs to return to the starting position after collecting all items. Given the positions of the vendors and the items they sell, determine the minimal number of vendors the buyer needs to visit. If multiple such subsets of vendors exist, choose the one that minimizes the buyer\'s total travel distance. Input Format The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k representing the number of vendors and the number of item types, respectively. Each of the next n lines describes a vendor. Each vendor\'s information is provided as follows: 1. An integer p indicating the vendor\'s position on the line. 2.

One possible way to achieve this by visiting a minimum number of vendors is: - Visit the vendor at position 2 (selling items 1 and 2) - Visit the vendor at position 10 (selling item 3) This requires visiting 2 vendors. However, the buyer can start at position 2, travel to position 14, and return to position 2 which covers all items and minimizes distance. Total travel distance is 12 (2 to 14 and back to 2).

Parameters: n (int): The number of positions each character is shifted in the ASCII table during encoding. s (str): The original string to encode and decode. Returns: str: The original string after encoding and then decoding to verify the process. encoded = encode(s, n) decoded = decode(encoded, n) return decoded"},{"question":"Alice has just started learning about binary search trees (BST) in her algorithms class. She decides to write a function to calculate the sum of all nodes that are between a given range [L, R] (inclusive) in a given BST. A binary search tree is defined as follows: - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\'s key. - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\'s key. - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. Help Alice write this function. **Input:** - The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of nodes in the BST. - The next n lines each contain an integer representing the value of a node in the BST. - The last line contains two integers L and R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9), the range of sum. **Output:** - A single integer, the sum of all node values that fall within the range [L, R] (inclusive). **Note:** - Each node value in the BST will be unique. - It is guaranteed that the BST contains at least one node. **Example:** _Input:_ ``` 7 10 5 15 3 7 18 2 7 15 ``` _Output:_ ``` 32 ``` Explanation: In this example, the BST looks like this: ``` 10 / 5 15 / 3 7 18 / 2 ``` Node values between 7 and 15 inclusive are 10, 7, and 15. Their sum is 32.","solution":"class TreeNode: def __init__(self, key): self.key = key self.left = None self.right = None def insert_bst(root, key): Inserts a key into the BST and returns the root of the tree. if root is None: return TreeNode(key) else: if key < root.key: root.left = insert_bst(root.left, key) else: root.right = insert_bst(root.right, key) return root def range_sum_bst(root, L, R): Calculates the sum of all nodes with values between L and R (inclusive). if root is None: return 0 if root.key < L: return range_sum_bst(root.right, L, R) elif root.key > R: return range_sum_bst(root.left, L, R) else: return root.key + range_sum_bst(root.left, L, R) + range_sum_bst(root.right, L, R)"},{"question":"Design a data structure that supports the following operations efficiently on a dynamic array of integers: - Initialization (create an empty array). - Append (add an integer to the end of the array). - Remove (remove the integer at a specified index). - Get (return the integer at a specified index). - Sum (return the sum of all integers in the array). The goal is to implement this data structure with as efficient time complexities for each operation as possible. -----Input----- First line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1000), the number of operations. The next q lines each contain one of the following operations: - \\"append x\\" (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) - append the integer x to the end of the array. - \\"remove i\\" (0 ≤ i < current length of array) - remove the integer at index i from the array. - \\"get i\\" (0 ≤ i < current length of array) - return the integer at index i. - \\"sum\\" - return the sum of all integers in the array. It is guaranteed that each \\"remove\\" and \\"get\\" operation will have a valid index. -----Output----- For each \\"get\\" and \\"sum\\" operation, print the result on a new line. -----Example----- Input 8 append 1 append 2 append 3 get 1 remove 1 get 1 sum append 4 sum Output 2 3 5 8","solution":"class DynamicArray: def __init__(self): self.array = [] def append(self, x): self.array.append(x) def remove(self, i): self.array.pop(i) def get(self, i): return self.array[i] def sum(self): return sum(self.array)"}]'),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const s=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return s?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(s)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(s)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},C={class:"card-container"},Y={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},P={key:1};function D(s,e,l,m,r,a){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",C,[(n(!0),i(_,null,w(a.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(p,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),a.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",Y,' No results found for "'+h(r.searchQuery)+'".
