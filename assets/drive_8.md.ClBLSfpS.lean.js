The algorithm proceeds as follows: 1. Initialize `k` centroids randomly. 2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance. 3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all the points assigned to each cluster. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or the algorithm has iterated the maximum number of times specified. Discuss how the choice of `k` influences the clustering: - Too small `k`: May result in large, heterogeneous clusters that fail to capture the structure in the data. - Too large `k`: Can lead to overfitting, where clusters are too small and closely fitted to individual data points.","solution":"from typing import List, Tuple import random def euclidean_distance(point1: List[float], point2: List[float]) -> float: return sum((x - y) ** 2 for x, y in zip(point1, point2)) ** 0.5 def calculate_centroids(clusters: List[List[List[float]]]) -> List[List[float]]: centroids = [] for cluster in clusters: centroid = [sum(dim)/len(cluster) for dim in zip(*cluster)] centroids.append(centroid) return centroids def assign_clusters(data: List[List[float]], centroids: List[List[float]]) -> List[int]: assignments = [] for point in data: distances = [euclidean_distance(point, centroid) for centroid in centroids] min_distance_index = distances.index(min(distances)) assignments.append(min_distance_index) return assignments def k_means_clustering(data: List[List[float]], k: int, max_iter: int) -> Tuple[List[List[float]], List[int]]: # Randomly initialize centroids initial_indices = random.sample(range(len(data)), k) centroids = [data[i] for i in initial_indices] for iteration in range(max_iter): # Assign points to the nearest centroid clusters = [[] for _ in range(k)] assignments = assign_clusters(data, centroids) for idx, assignment in enumerate(assignments): clusters[assignment].append(data[idx]) # Calculate new centroids new_centroids = calculate_centroids(clusters) # If centroids do not change, break the loop if new_centroids == centroids: break centroids = new_centroids return centroids, assignments"},{"question":"Implement a function that takes a list of transactions and a date, and returns the balance of the account at the end of that day.

To control the traffic flow, you must ensure that there is no deadlock or collisions due to vehicles from both directions entering the intersection simultaneously.

Each vehicle will call `enterIntersection` when it reaches the intersection and `exitIntersection` once it leaves the intersection. You must write a synchronization code that ensures vehicles from both directions can pass through the intersection without causing a traffic jam and that vehicles from one direction give way if the intersection is already occupied by a vehicle from the opposite direction. To elaborate: If a northbound vehicle reaches the intersection when a southbound vehicle is already in the intersection, it must wait until the intersection is free. If a southbound vehicle reaches the intersection when a northbound vehicle is already in the intersection, it must wait until the intersection is free. Vehicles must pass through the intersection in the order they arrive, without skipping or cutting in front of other vehicles.

The database in question is called `company` and contains a table named `employees`. Your focus will be on updating the salary of employees based on specific conditions and ensuring the operation\'s consistency and completeness. **Objectives:** 1. Write a function that performs the following operations in an atomic transaction: - Increase the salary of employees by 10% if their current salary is less than a specified threshold. - Decrease the salary of employees by 5% if their current salary exceeds a specified threshold. - Ensure that the minimum salary after the transaction is not less than a designated minimum salary limit. 2. Provide an example of erroneous code where the transaction management is handled improperly. This should include issues such as the lack of transaction commit/rollback, improper error handling, or incorrect SQL queries. The candidate should identify and explain the mistakes in this code. 3. Ensure robust error handling within the function by: - Catching any errors that occur during the transaction. - Rolling back the transaction if an error is detected. - Providing meaningful error messages that aid in diagnosing the problem. - Committing the transaction only if all operations are completed successfully. Consider utilizing `try...catch` blocks or equivalent constructs for handling potential errors in executing MySQL operations. **Assumptions:** - Assume available connection objects and methods for interacting with the database. **Sample Erroneous Code:** ```python def update_salaries_erroneous(db_connection, salary_threshold, min_salary_limit): try: cursor = db_connection.cursor() # Incorrect query to increase salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE salary < salary_threshold\\") # Incorrect error handling and transaction management if cursor.rowcount <= 0: raise Exception(\\"No rows affected\\") # Incorrect query to decrease salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 0.95 WHERE salary > salary_threshold\\") cursor.commit() # Incorrect usage except Exception as e: print(\\"An error occurred:\\", e) cursor.rollback() # Incorrect usage ``` **Corrected Version and Explanation:** ```python def update_salaries(db_connection, salary_threshold, min_salary_limit): try: cursor = db_connection.cursor() # Start transaction db_connection.begin() # Correct query to increase salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE salary < %s\\", (salary_threshold,)) # Correct query to decrease salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 0.95 WHERE salary > %s\\", (salary_threshold,)) # Ensure the minimum salary limit is respected cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = %s WHERE salary < %s\\", (min_salary_limit, min_salary_limit)) # Commit the transaction only if all operations were successful db_connection.commit() except Exception as e: # Rollback the transaction in case of error print(\\"An error occurred: Transaction failed. Rolling back changes.\\", e) db_connection.rollback() finally: cursor.close() ``` **Explanation of Errors:** 1. **Improper SQL Queries**: In the erroneous code, threshold comparison was not parameterized correctly which can lead to SQL injection issues. The corrected code properly uses parameterized queries. 2. **Transaction Management**: The erroneous code lacks proper transaction management commands (`begin`, `commit`, `rollback`). The corrected code explicitly begins the transaction, commits on success, and rolls back on failure. 3. **Error Handling**: The erroneous code has primitive error handling and incorrect usage of rollback and commit methods. In the corrected version, errors are caught, meaningful messages are provided, the transaction is rolled back if any step fails, and the cursor is properly closed in a `finally` block.","solution":"def update_salaries(db_connection, salary_threshold, min_salary_limit): try: cursor = db_connection.cursor() # Start transaction db_connection.begin() # Correct query to increase salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE salary < %s\\", (salary_threshold,)) # Correct query to decrease salaries cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 0.95 WHERE salary > %s\\", (salary_threshold,)) # Ensure the minimum salary limit is respected cursor.execute(\\"UPDATE employees SET salary = %s WHERE salary < %s\\", (min_salary_limit, min_salary_limit)) # Commit the transaction only if all operations were successful db_connection.commit() except Exception as e: # Rollback the transaction in case of error print(\\"An error occurred: Transaction failed.

The application should allow users to send and receive messages in real-time. Here are the detailed requirements for both the server and client sides: # Server Requirements: 1. **Connection Handling**: The server must handle multiple client connections concurrently. 2. **Broadcasting**: When a client sends a message, the server should broadcast it to all connected clients. 3. **Message Format**: Prepend each message with the sender’s username before broadcasting. 4. **Client Disconnections**: Gracefully handle client disconnections and notify remaining clients. 5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions and unforeseen issues. # Client Requirements: 1. **Connection to Server**: Allow the client to connect to the server. 2. **User Input**: Enable users to input their messages and send them to the server. 3. **Display Messages**: Display incoming messages from the server in real-time. 4. **Username Entry**: Prompt users to enter their username at the start of the session. 5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to respond to connection issues and disconnections. # Scenario Consider a scenario where previous implementation relied on a simplistic socket handling mechanism with blocking calls.

The tool should be able to import contacts from a CSV file, ensuring that duplicate entries are managed effectively (by either merging them or skipping the duplicates based on user preference). Your software should provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) with clear prompts and feedback messages. Furthermore, incorporate error handling to manage inputs such as invalid email formats, non-numeric phone numbers, and any issues during the import/export processes. Lastly, ensure that the data persists between sessions by storing it in a suitable file format (e.g., JSON, XML, or SQLite database). You may use external libraries for file handling and input validation to maintain code readability and reliability. Write a program that provides this functionality, ensuring adherence to best coding practices and efficiency in handling a large number of contacts.","solution":"import csv import json import re class Contact: def __init__(self, name, phone, email, tag): self.name = name self.phone = phone self.email = email self.tag = tag def to_dict(self): return {\\"name\\": self.name, \\"phone\\": self.phone, \\"email\\": self.email, \\"tag\\": self.tag} class ContactManager: def __init__(self, storage_file=\'contacts.json\'): self.contacts = [] self.storage_file = storage_file self.load_contacts() def add_contact(self, name, phone, email, tag): if not self.validate_email(email): raise ValueError(\\"Invalid email format\\") if not phone.isdigit(): raise ValueError(\\"Phone number must be numeric\\") contact = Contact(name, phone, email, tag) self.contacts.append(contact) self.save_contacts() def edit_contact(self, index, name=None, phone=None, email=None, tag=None): if index < 0 or index >= len(self.contacts): raise IndexError(\\"Contact index out of range\\") if email and not self.validate_email(email): raise ValueError(\\"Invalid email format\\") if phone and not phone.isdigit(): raise ValueError(\\"Phone number must be numeric\\") contact = self.contacts[index] if name: contact.name = name if phone: contact.phone = phone if email: contact.email = email if tag: contact.tag = tag self.save_contacts() def delete_contact(self, index): if index < 0 or index >= len(self.contacts): raise IndexError(\\"Contact index out of range\\") del self.contacts[index] self.save_contacts() def search_contacts(self, query): return [c.to_dict() for c in self.contacts if query.lower() in c.name.lower()] def export_contacts(self, csv_file): fields = [\'name\', \'phone\', \'email\', \'tag\'] with open(csv_file, \'w\', newline=\'\') as file: writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fields) writer.writeheader() for contact in self.contacts: writer.writerow(contact.to_dict()) def import_contacts(self, csv_file, merge=True): with open(csv_file, newline=\'\') as file: reader = csv.DictReader(file) for row in reader: if merge: if not any(c.email == row[\'email\'] for c in self.contacts): self.contacts.append(Contact(**row)) else: self.contacts.append(Contact(**row)) self.save_contacts() def save_contacts(self): with open(self.storage_file, \'w\') as file: json.dump([contact.to_dict() for contact in self.contacts], file) def load_contacts(self): try: with open(self.storage_file, \'r\') as file: contacts = json.load(file) self.contacts = [Contact(**c) for c in contacts] except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError): self.contacts = [] @staticmethod def validate_email(email): regex = r\'^b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}b\' return re.match(regex, email) is not None"},{"question":"You need to create a function that finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

Convert the min-heap into a sorted list in descending order and return it. **Function Signature:** ```python from typing import List def find_k_largest_elements(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]: pass ``` **Examples:** ```python # Example 1 nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4] k = 2 print(find_k_largest_elements(nums, k)) # Expected Output: [6, 5] # Example 2 nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3] k = 2 print(find_k_largest_elements(nums, k)) # Expected Output: [3, 2] # Example 3 nums = [9, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 8, 9] k = 3 print(find_k_largest_elements(nums, k)) # Expected Output: [9, 9, 9] ```","solution":"from typing import List import heapq def find_k_largest_elements(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]: if k == 0: return [] # Create a min-heap with the first k elements min_heap = nums[:k] heapq.heapify(min_heap) # Iterate through the rest of the input list for num in nums[k:]: if num > min_heap[0]: heapq.heappop(min_heap) # Remove the smallest element heapq.heappush(min_heap, num) # Add the current element # Convert the heap into a list sorted in descending order return sorted(min_heap, reverse=True)"},{"question":"In this problem, you are required to create a function named `polynomial_deriv` that can compute the derivative of a polynomial. The polynomial will be given as a list of coefficients, with the nth element of the list representing the coefficient for the x^n term. Your task is to implement the `polynomial_deriv` function that should handle the following: - If the input list length is 1, implying a constant polynomial, the derivative should be a polynomial with a single term 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0). - Otherwise, return a new list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial. The function should ignore leading zero coefficients in the resulting list unless the result is the zero polynomial. Your `polynomial_deriv` function should be defined as: ```python def polynomial_deriv(coefficients): # Your implementation here ``` Examples: ```python print(polynomial_deriv([3, 2, 1])) # Should output [2, 2], corresponding to the derivative 2 + 2x. print(polynomial_deriv([0, 0, 1])) # Should output [0, 2], corresponding to the derivative 2x. print(polynomial_deriv([5])) # Should output [0], since the derivative of a constant is 0. print(polynomial_deriv([0, 0, 0])) # Should output [0], handling the zero polynomial case. ```","solution":"def polynomial_deriv(coefficients): Returns the derivative of the given polynomial as a list of coefficients.

The library needs to keep track of the books that are currently checked out and those that are available. Your task is to write a class named `Library` that manages the books in the library. Each book is uniquely identified by its title and has properties such as the author and publication year. The `Library` class should support the following operations: 1. Adding a new book to the library. 2. Checking out a book. 3. Returning a book. 4. Listing all books currently available in the library. 5. Listing all books currently checked out. Below is the exact class definition you should implement. ```python class Library: def __init__(self): Initializes the library with no books. self.available_books = {} self.checked_out_books = {} def add_book(self, title: str, author: str, year: int): Adds a new book to the library.
