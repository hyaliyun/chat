You will implement two main functionalities to work with square matrices: power calculation and matrix operations for dynamic systems modeling. Background Matrix multiplication and exponentiation are crucial in modeling dynamic systems where the state can be represented by large vectors, and the system\'s evolution is governed by matrix operations over time. # Task Description 1. **Implement Matrix Power Calculation**: Write a function `matrix_power(mat: List[List[int]], power: int) -> List[List[int]]` that raises a matrix `mat` to the power `power` using efficient repeated squaring. **Input**: - `mat`: A 2D list of integers representing an (n times n) matrix where (2 leq n leq 100). - `power`: An integer (`0 leq power leq 1000`). **Output**: - A 2D list of integers representing (mat^{power}). 2. **Implement Matrix State Transition**: Given an initial state vector and a state transition matrix, compute the state of the system after a certain number of transitions using your `matrix_power` function. Write a function `state_transition(mat: List[List[int]], state: List[int], transitions: int) -> List[int]`. **Input**: - `mat`: A 2D list of integers representing an (n times n) state transition matrix where (2 leq n leq 100). - `state`: A list of integers of size `n` representing the initial state vector. - `transitions`: An integer (`0 leq transitions leq 1000`) representing the number of transitions. **Output**: - A list of integers representing the state of the system after the given number of transitions. # Constraints 1. Handle edge cases such as zero power, which should return the identity matrix. 2. Ensure matrix multiplication is handled efficiently to not exceed time limits. # Performance - Aim for an overall time complexity of (O(n^3 log(k))) for raising matrices to power (k). - Matrix multiplication should operate within (O(n^3)) constraints. The solution must be optimized for performance to handle the upper limits of input sizes effectively.","solution":"def matrix_mult(A, B): n = len(A) C = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)] for i in range(n): for j in range(n): for k in range(n): C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j] return C def matrix_power(mat, power): n = len(mat) result = [[1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)] base = mat while power: if power % 2 == 1: result = matrix_mult(result, base) base = matrix_mult(base, base) power //= 2 return result def state_transition(mat, state, transitions): n = len(mat) powered_matrix = matrix_power(mat, transitions) result_state = [0] * n for i in range(n): for j in range(n): result_state[i] += powered_matrix[i][j] * state[j] return result_state"},{"question":"# Question **Scenario**: Imagine you are developing features for a mapping application where users can search for the k closest landmarks to their current location.

You are required to implement the Merge Sort algorithm from scratch, focusing on its fundamental mechanics and optimizing the space usage during merging. Task: Write a function `merge_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]` that sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.

Function Specification: * **Input**: A list of integers, `arr` with a maximum length of 10^5. * **Output**: A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. Constraints: * You may not use any built-in sorting functions. * The solution must handle arrays with up to 100,000 integers efficiently. * Do not change the signature of the provided function.

Handle all the edge cases, like empty or already sorted arrays. 2. Consider the space complexity and optimize the memory usage where possible. 3.

However, its performance largely depends on the choice of pivot. The median-of-three method is an optimization technique that selects the pivot as the median of three elements (first, middle, last) in the array, reducing the probability of encountering the worst-case performance. Problem Statement Implement the Quick Sort algorithm with the `median-of-three` pivot selection strategy and include a switch to insertion sort for sub-arrays smaller than a given threshold `k`.
