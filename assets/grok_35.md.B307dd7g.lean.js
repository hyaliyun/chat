Sample palindromes include \\"madam\\", \\"radar\\", \\"level\\", and \\"a man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\\". # Task Write a python program that takes a string as an input and checks whether the string is a palindrome or not. Step 1: Define a function to check if a string is a palindrome We can define a function called \`is_palindrome\` that takes a string \`s\` as input. Step 2: Remove spaces and punctuation from the string We can use the \`re\` module to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string. This will also convert the string to lowercase to ignore case. Step 3: Compare the string with its reverse We can compare the modified string with its reverse. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome. Step 4: Return the result We can return \`True\` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise return \`False\`. Here is the python code for the above steps: \`\`\`python import re def is_palindrome(s): # remove spaces and punctuation from the string s = re.sub(r'W+', '', s).lower() # compare the string with its reverse return s == s[::-1] # test the function print(is_palindrome(\\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\\")) # True print(is_palindrome(\\"Not a palindrome\\")) # False \`\`\` I'll now explain how this code works. Explanation of the code: This code defines a function \`is_palindrome\` that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. The function uses the \`re.sub\` method from the \`re\` module to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string, and converts it to lowercase. It then compares the modified string with its reverse using slicing (\`s[::-1]\`). If the string is the same forwards and backwards, the function returns \`True\`, otherwise it returns \`False\`. The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's usage. The first test case checks a well-known palindrome, \\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\\", and the function correctly returns \`True\`. The second test case checks a string that is not a palindrome, \\"Not a palindrome\\", and the function correctly returns \`False\`. Now, let's talk about the time complexity of the code. Time complexity: The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the \`re.sub\` method and the slicing operation both have a time complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n). What do you think?","solution":"import re def is_palindrome(s): Check if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and capitalization. # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase cleaned_s = re.sub(r'W+', '', s).lower() # Check if the string is equal to its reverse return cleaned_s == cleaned_s[::-1]"},{"question":"Twin primes are prime numbers that differ by 2.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. To solve this problem, we can create a new string that is the input string concatenated with its reverse. We then need to find the longest proper prefix of this new string that is also a suffix. This proper prefix is essentially the shortest palindrome we can embed in the original string. However, the given string may already be a palindrome, so we should check for this case and return the string itself if it is. Here is the python code I came up with: \`\`\` def shortest_palindrome(s): if s == s[::-1]: #check for palindrome return s else: rev_s = s[::-1] #reverse for i in range(len(s), -1, -1): #generate all prefixes of the reverse string pref = rev_s[:i] if pref in s: #check if prefix is in s return pref+s[i:] #return the shortest palindrome # Test cases print(shortest_palindrome(\\"aacecaaa\\")) # Output: \\"aaacecaaa\\" print(shortest_palindrome(\\"abcd\\")) # Output: \\"dcbabcd\\" \`\`\` However this seems inefficient since I'm iterating through all prefixes of the reverse string, and also using the \`in\` operator which has an average time complexity of \`O(n)\`. Here is my second attempt at solving this problem. This time I use a KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm to find the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix in linear time: \`\`\` def compute_prefix_function(s): m = len(s) pi = [0] * m k = 0 for q in range(1, m): while k > 0 and s[k] != s[q]: k = pi[k - 1] if s[k] == s[q]: k = k + 1 pi[q] = k return pi def kmp(s, word): n, m = len(s), len(word) pi = compute_prefix_function(word) q = 0 for i in range(n): while q > 0 and s[i] != word[q]: q = pi[q - 1] if s[i] == word[q]: q = q + 1 if q == m: return True def shortest_palindrome(s): if s == s[::-1]: #check for palindrome return s else: rev_s = s[::-1] #reverse for i in range(len(s), -1, -1): #generate all prefixes of the reverse string pref = rev_s[:i] if kmp(s, pref): return pref+s[i:] #return the shortest palindrome \`\`\` While this solution is better, I do not think it is optimal because there is repeated computation. In the \`kmp\` function I'm recomputing the prefix function for every prefix of the reverse string. This is clearly unnecessary as the prefix function only needs to be computed once. So here is my final solution that uses the KMP algorithm only once: \`\`\` def compute_prefix_function(s): m = len(s) pi = [0] * m k = 0 for q in range(1, m): while k > 0 and s[k] != s[q]: k = pi[k - 1] if s[k] == s[q]: k = k + 1 pi[q] = k return pi def shortest_palindrome(s): if s == s[::-1]: #check for palindrome return s else: rev_s = s[::-1] #reverse t = s + '#' + rev_s #generate search word pi = compute_prefix_function(t) return rev_s[:pi[-1]]+s #return the shortest palindrome \`\`\` This solution first checks if the input string is already a palindrome. Then it computes the prefix function for the string that is the input string concatenated with its reverse and a special character. The last element of the prefix function then gives the length of the shortest palindrome that can be embedded in the original string. Finally this shortest palindrome is returned.

My current implementation is the following: \`\`\` def findMin(nums): if not nums: raise ValueError(\\"input array is empty\\") if len(nums) == 1: return nums[0] l,r = 0, len(nums) - 1 while l < r: m = (l + r) // 2 if nums[m] > nums[r]: l = m + 1 else: r = m return nums[l] \`\`\` This code currently only works for the standard case (as described earlier) in which there are no duplicates in the array. However, if there are duplicates, the code will run into issues. For example, the following input will cause the code to fail: \`\`\` findMin([4, 4, 4, 1, 2]) \`\`\` How can I improve my code to handle this edge case?","solution":"def findMin(nums): if not nums: raise ValueError(\\"input array is empty\\") if len(nums) == 1: return nums[0] l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1 while l < r: m = (l + r) // 2 if nums[m] > nums[r]: l = m + 1 elif nums[m] < nums[r]: r = m else: # nums[m] == nums[r], we can't be sure if the minimum is on the left or right r -= 1 # Eliminate the duplicate from the right end return nums[l]"},{"question":"A company needs to ship a large number of boxes from one warehouse to several locations.

Consider raising a ValueError to let the user know that the format is not recognized. 2. Handle the case when the input number is negative. Currently, the function will raise a ValueError if a negative number is used as input. Consider documenting or explicitly handling this case. 3. Use a loop instead of the list comprehension with join. While list comprehensions are useful, they are generally less readable when working with non-trivial strings or multiple iterations. Consider using a loop for better readability. 4. Add type hints for better code readability and type checking. Adding type hints will let other developers know what input type is expected, and what output type can be expected.

The script requires passwords to contain only random assignments of 4 fixed characters (ascii), only uppercase alphabets, only lowercase alphabets, only numbers, only special symbols. 2. The built-in filter method does not filter anything and it's unclear what it is supposed to do. Here are the recommended improvements according to the Parola design principles: 1. Implement the following options into the get_password() method: * Use a mix of random combinations of ascii, uppercase alphabets, lowercase alphabets, numbers, and special symbols; * Exclude a certain set of characters; * Allow user to specify a password length; * Allow user to specify a password string length when calling get_password function. 2. Repair the filter method as follows: * The method should exclude the characters the user specified. * The method should return only one set of characters, like only lowercase alphabets or only special symbols. 3. Implement a new feature that allows users to generate a password using their master password. The new method, named get_password_from_master(), should take 2 parameters: the master password and a string or string list representing the service or website that will use the generated password. 4. After implementing the above functionalities, the Parola password generators should be able to respond to the following commands correctly: * \`get_password(length=8, use_ascii=True, use_uppercase=True, use_numbers=True, use_special=True)\` * \`get_password(length=12, use_uppercase=True, use_numbers=True, exclude=['!', '@', '","solution":"import string import random import hashlib # The main password generator class class Parola: @staticmethod def filter(char_set, exclude_chars): Filters out the excluded characters from the given character set. :param char_set: A string representing the set of characters to choose from. :param exclude_chars: A list of characters to exclude from char_set. :return: A filtered string with excluded characters removed. return ''.join(ch for ch in char_set if ch not in exclude_chars) @staticmethod def get_password(length=8, use_ascii=False, use_uppercase=False, use_lowercase=False, use_numbers=False, use_special=False, exclude=[]): Generates a random password incorporating specified criteria. :param length: Length of the password to generate (default: 8) :param use_ascii: Use ASCII letters (default: False) :param use_uppercase: Use uppercase letters (default: False) :param use_lowercase: Use lowercase letters (default: False) :param use_numbers: Use digits (default: False) :param use_special: Use special characters (default: False) :param exclude: List of characters to exclude (default: empty list) :return: Generated password as a string. char_set = '' if use_ascii: char_set += string.ascii_letters if use_uppercase: char_set += string.ascii_uppercase if use_lowercase: char_set += string.ascii_lowercase if use_numbers: char_set += string.digits if use_special: char_set += string.punctuation char_set = Parola.filter(char_set, exclude) if length <= 0 or not char_set: raise ValueError(\\"Password length must be greater than 0 and char_set should not be empty.\\") password = ''.join(random.choice(char_set) for _ in range(length)) return password @staticmethod def get_password_from_master(master_password, service): Generates a password based on a master password and service name using hashing. :param master_password: The master password string. :param service: The service name associated with the password. :return: Generated password string. combined = f\\"{master_password}{service}\\" hash_result = hashlib.sha256(combined.encode()).hexdigest() return hash_result[:16] # Return only the first 16 characters"},{"question":"This Problem is delivered from the Practice Problem set of GitHub.

An user can send friend request to only one another user. Each user can't send friend request to himself.

As friends can be made from both the ends, there's no distinction of sender and receiver. To make the friend request system more Intuitive and interactive, there are few methods to return the friends/contact lists. connections(user_id): returns a list of friends contact. For example connections(user_id1) returns back the ID list of all the friends of user_id1 groups(user_id): groups of friends are considered as a collections/list of friends where each friend knows others. groups(user_id1) and groups(user_id2) will be same if they have common friends in some group.

The assigned penalty points are doubled during certain times of the year or on particular roads and also if the driver is a repeat offender. We want to calculate the penalty points for given conditions. Assume the following categories: A: car B: motorbike C: bus D: truck For each vehicle category, the minimum penalty points for a single offense are as follows: A: 3 points B: 2 points C: 5 points D: 6 points If the vehicle is driven during certain times of the year (e.g., holidays) or on specific roads (e.g., highways, construction zones), the penalty points will be doubled.

An ugly number is a positive number whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. By convention, 1 is also an ugly number. Write a function in Python that finds the maximum ugly number less than a given number. Here is the example of the code that could solve the problem with brute force: \`\`\`python def nth_ugly_number(n): count = 0 num = 1 while True: if is_ugly(num): count += 1 if count == n: return num num += 1 def is_ugly(num): if num == 1: return True for p in 2, 3, 5: while num % p == 0: num //= p return num == 1 \`\`\` This example code first defines the helper function \`is_ugly\` that returns \`True\` if the given number is ugly, otherwise it returns \`False\`. The main function \`nth_ugly_number\` uses the helper function to generate the first \`n\` ugly numbers and find the \`n\`th number by iteration. However, we want to write a Python function that is less dependent on the \`is_ugly\` helper function. Here is the solution. \`\`\`python def nth_ugly_number(n): ugly = [1] i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0 while len(ugly) < n: next_ugly = min(ugly[i2] * 2, ugly[i3] * 3, ugly[i5] * 5) ugly.append(next_ugly) if next_ugly == ugly[i2] * 2: i2 += 1 if next_ugly == ugly[i3] * 3: i3 += 1 if next_ugly == ugly[i5] * 5: i5 += 1 return ugly[-1] \`\`\` The function first initializes an array with the first ugly number and three indices (for each prime multiplier: 2, 3, 5). The algorithm then enters a while loop that continues until the list is long enough to include \`n\` ugly numbers. The next ugly number is generated as the smallest value from the set of values get by introduction of factors 2, 3 and 5 to the existing sequence. The threshold index corresponding to smallest value is moved one spot forward and the generated number is added to a sequence of ugly numbers. And when the loop ends, the function returns the largest element in the sequence. The algorithm works well for this task and does not employ nested loop. Now, let's write a code function that can find the maximum ugly number which is less than a given number. The problem asks us to solve this using DP (dynamic programming).

First generate the ** carrier ** (aka reference) signal with a higher frequency as compared to PLC Ladder Logic signals (typically we create this carrier frequency to be around 10 Hz higher than the maximum frequency we want our PLC Ladder Logic signal to be). 2. Next generate each PLC Ladder Logic signal. 3. To create AM Modulation (Amplitude Modulation), for each of the PLC Ladder Logic signal, multiply the carrier signal by the PLC Ladder Logic signal. This is mathematically equivalent to adding each PLC Ladder Logic signal with an **inverted** PLC Ladder Logic signal that is **shifted** by the carrier frequency. 4. Then **add** all of the above AM Modulations (6 of them) together to create the transmission signal that will be send over the antenna. Okay, so this summary of the steps is somewhat detailed. It is at this level that the project maintained if error occurs - this level is about generating frequency setting for the PLC Ladder Logic signals and selection of carrier frequency and generation of the transmission signal. How would you code this algorithm in Python if you were to integrate this with PLC Ladder Logic signals that are 1 Hz apart as the maximum frequency? This is typically a frequency range of 1-10 Hz, with the carrier signal set to 20 Hz. So, the code should be able to take a list of frequencies of the PLC Ladder Logic signals as input and generate the carrier, the Ladder Logic signals, and the resulting transmission signal, in turn. We need to specify the sampling frequency and the time for which we need the signals to be generated. I can provide more details if needed. To confirm, here is the example: * we want to sample the signal at 100 Hz * we want the signal to have a duration of 60 seconds * we want carrier frequency to 20 Hz * we want PLC signals to be at 1-6 Hz (six frequencies) Assuming the time domain t and sampling frequency Fs are given, how would you proceed given the above as reference? First of all, to create these signals and perform AM Modulation, we would need to use NumPy. Here is an example of how to generate a sine wave signal: \`\`\`python np.sin(2 * np.pi * (10) * t) \`\`\` In this example, the frequency of the signal is 10 Hz. Here is a basic example of a code to get you started.

Inside the square, inscribe a circle of radius 1 by drawing lines from the origin to each vertex of the square. Suppose we pick n points at random within the square. Some of these points will fall on the boundary of the circle or within the circle, and the rest will fall outside the circle. Let k be the number of points within or on the boundary of the circle.

Background: RGB images are built from pixels, each having three components: R (red), G (green) and B (blue). Pixels in the entire image are arranged in a 2D grid. Problem: Imagine you have an RGB image represented as a 2D grid of RGB pixels. Your task is to implement a simple image filter that alters the colors of the image while maintaining the same number of pixels. There are two filters described below: 1) A Grayscale filter, which converts the color images to Grayscale format using the following formula for each pixel at a position (i, j): R_new = 0.21 * R_old + 0.72 * G_old + 0.07 * B_old G_new = 0.21 * R_old + 0.72 * G_old + 0.07 * B_old B_new = 0.21 * R_old + 0.72 * G_old + 0.07 * B_old 2) A Sepia filter, which converts the images to Sepia tone format using the following formulas for each pixel at a position (i, j) R_new = R_old* 0.393 + G_old * 0.769 + B_old * 0.189 G_new = R_old * 0.349 + G_old * 0.686 + B_old * 0.168 B_new = R_old * 0.272 + G_old * 0.534 + B_old * 0.131 Your goal is to solve this problem to satisfy the following: - a) The input to the system should be a 2D grid of pixels with RGB values, - b) Each pixel should be an Int32 value representing the RGB values, e.g., \`new RGB(125, 255, 0)\` where properties R, G and B represent the Red, Green and Blue component of a pixel respectively. - c) The output should be a new 2D grid of pixels that applies the Grayscale and/or Sepia filters.

A DNA nucleotide is one of four types: 'A' (Adenine), 'C' (Cytosine), 'G' (Guanine), and 'T' (Thymine). We need to determine the number of runs of consecutive occurrences of the same nucleotide in the sequence. For example, the sequence ('A', 'A', 'C', 'T', 'T') has 3 runs. Here is a simple recursive, non-memoized, function in Python that calculates the number of runs. The base case checks if the input is empty, and returns 0 runs for that case.

The function should return \`True\` if the rectangle intersects the circle with a center point (cx, cy) and a radius \`r\`, otherwise \`False\`. **Here is my (incorrect) code:** \`\`\`python def does_intersect(x0, y0, x1, y1, cx, cy, r): if x1 < cx - r or x0 > cx + r or y0 > cy + r or y1 < cy - r: return False # closest point to the circle within the rectangle closest_x = max(x0, min(cx, x1)) closest_y = max(y0, min(cy, y1)) # distance between the closest point and the center of the circle distance_x = cx - closest_x distance_y = cy - closest_y # if the distance is less than or equal to the radius, the rectangle intersects the circle return distance_x ** 2 + distance_y ** 2 <= r ** 2 \`\`\` **Can you offer any insight into my code, and propose a simpler solution?","solution":"def does_intersect(x0, y0, x1, y1, cx, cy, r): Determine if a rectangle intersects a circle.

It seems like the use of a tree structure would be helpful in solving this problem. Do you think it would be beneficial to also use queue data structure in addition to the tree data structure to solve this problem? Yes, I do. First of all, since we only start in state p1 and only end in p6, a BFS(Breadth-first search) would be efficient over other ways to traverse the game tree if using a queue data structure. Also since each game state only has two valid moves, a queue would also be helpful in simulating a BFS of the game tree. However, there is a question... how do we find the solution from p1 to p6 for this game where the valid moves are a mix of letters and symbols? The solution to this question is that the tree data structure list every single move. list every single possible move, whether it is a letter or symbol, for each game state at every level, and then the queue data structure uses BFS to add and remove the nodes level by level from the tree. Given the fact that we cannot traverse the queue manually, we need to traverse the queue programmatically. Which programming language would you choose. I would personally choose Python for the following reasons: 1. Python is an easy to learn programming language. It takes less time to set up a queue data structure and the corresponding game tree and code the logic of the BFS algorithm. 2. Python is a versatile language that can manipulate the wide variety of strings present in this problem for the moves: letters and symbols. 3. Python is a widely used and well-supported language with numerous resources available for the implementation of a BFS from a tree structure. 4. Python supports a wide variety of data structures. 5.

What is the difference between the synchronous vs asynchronous approach to web scraping?","solution":"def explain_scraping_approaches(): Explains the difference between synchronous and asynchronous approaches to web scraping. synchronous_approach = In synchronous web scraping, the requests to the server are made one at a time. The program waits for each request to complete before making the next request. This means the execution happens sequentially. Pros: - Simple to implement and understand. - Easier to debug. - Suitable for small-scale scraping tasks. Cons: - Slower for large-scale scraping as it waits for each request to complete before proceeding. - Can be blocked by network latency or slow server responses. Libraries commonly used: requests, BeautifulSoup, lxml. asynchronous_approach = In asynchronous web scraping, multiple requests to the server are made concurrently. The program doesn't wait for each request to complete before making the next request. This means the execution can happen in parallel.

This implementation uses the Newton-Raphson method, an iterative numerical method used to find successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function. 2. It starts with an initial guess (\`prev_guess\`) of \`0\` and an initial approximate value (\`curr_guess\`) of \`10\`. 3.

This process repeats until the difference between the current guess and the previous guess (\`curr_guess - prev_guess\`) is less than a specified precision (\`precision\`). 5. The loop exit condition is when the absolute difference between the last two guesses is less than the precision (\`precision\`). 6. Finally, it returns the last guess as the fourth root of \`n\`.

Write a simple markdown markup language and translator # Problem Statement Markdown is a light markup language commonly used to format text for online communities, documentation pages, and blogs. Write a simple markdown markup language translator, supporting the following basic syntax: * Headers '#' followed by a space and the header title. * Emphasis, denoted by single asterisks (*) around the text. * links, which consist of a text between square brackets '[]' following by an accompanied link between parenthesis \\"()'. Design a program that reads a markdown text and translates it to its corresponding HTML format. # # Sample Input and Output The following is a sample markdown text and its equivalent HTML translation. **Markdown Sample** # This is a Header *This is emphasized* This is a [Link](https://www.avyuktizm/ HTML Sample # <h1>This is a Header</h1> <p><em>This is emphasized</em></p> <p>This is a <a href=\\"https://www.Avyuktizm.coml\\">Link</a></p> # # Step 1: Design the Translator Program We need to write a program that can read markdown text and translate it into HTML. We will start by designing the translator program which will handle the translation of headers, emphasis, and links. Step 2: Handling Headers Handle the translation of headers which start with '#' followed by a space and the header title. The header level is determined by the number of '#' characters. Step 3: Handling Emphasis Handle the translation of emphasis which are denoted by single asterisks (*) around the text. Step 4: Handling Links Handle the translation of links, which consist of a text between square brackets '[]' followed by an accompanied link between parentheses \\"()\\". # Explanation Incorrect Step: Step 4. The original solution does not provide a complete implementation of the program, and the handling of links is not correctly explained. A correct implementation should include a loop to find links in the text format [text](link) and replace them with their corresponding HTML format <a href=\\"link\\">text</a>. # Correct Solution Step 1: Write a function to translate headers First, we define a function that can translate headers from markdown format to HTML. We use regular expression to match the header pattern and replace it with the corresponding HTML header format. \`\`\`python import re def translate_header(markdown_text): header_pattern = r'^(#+) (.*)' def replace(match): header_level = len(match.group(1)) return '<h' + str(header_level) + '>' + match.group(2) + '</h' + str(header_level) + '>' translated_text = re.sub(header_pattern, replace, markdown_text, flags=re.MULTILINE) return translated_text \`\`\` Step 2: Write a function to translate emphasis Next, we define a function that can translate emphasis from markdown format to HTML. We use regular expression to match the emphasis pattern and replace it with the corresponding HTML emphasis format. \`\`\`python def translate_emphasis(markdown_text): emphasis_pattern = r'*(.*?","solution":"import re def markdown_to_html(markdown_text): Translates Markdown text to HTML. #

Step 4: Implement the Color Tag Extraction and Mapping We'll write a function to extract the color tags from the input text and map them to the corresponding colors. Step 5: Implement the Output Text Rendering We'll write a function to render the output text with the colored words.

To connect all the houses with the lowest total cost, we can use a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Step 1: Define the Graph Data Structure The minimum spanning tree problem requires a graph data structure. We will use a weighted undirected graph represented as an adjacency list. Step 2: Choose a Starting Vertex Select an arbitrary vertex as the starting point. This vertex will be the root of our minimum spanning tree. Step 3: Initialize the Minimum Spanning Tree Create an empty minimum spanning tree (MST) to store the selected edges. Step 4: Find the Minimum Edge Find the minimum-weight edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex not yet in the MST. If no such edge exists, stop. Step 5: Add the Minimum Edge to the MST Add the minimum edge found in step 4 to the MST. Step 6: Repeat Steps 4-5 Until All Vertices are Connected Continue finding and adding minimum edges until all vertices are connected.

The display consists of an unbounded two-dimensional array, essentially an infinite grid of pixels. A pixel is located at coordinates (x, y), where x and y are integers, and is either \\"on\\" (1) or \\"off\\" (0). You can create a \\"rectangle\\" of pixels by specifying the coordinates of its top-left (x1, y1) and bottom-right (x2, y2) corners. Implement the function get_content_of_rectangle(), which gets the specified rectangle of pixels and returns the sum of the pixel values within that rectangle as a count. The display starts empty (all pixels are off). Pixels can be toggled on or off with the \`suppress\` function. Example: \`\`\` display = RectangleContent(<empty initial state>) print(display.get_content_of_rectangle(0, 0, 1, 1)) # Output: 0 display.suppress(0, 0) print(display.get_content_of_rectangle(0, 0, 1, 1)) # Output: 1 display.suppress(1, 1) print(display.get_content_of_rectangle(0, 0, 1, 1)) # Output: 2 \`\`\` You need to maintain a data structure to store the state of the pixels and to efficiently query and update their state. Considering the high memory usage and performance impact of creating a huge sparse matrix, a more efficient approach is to use a hash map data structure. When \`suppress\` function is called, it will toggle the state of the pixel at the given coordinates. If the pixel doesn't exist in the hash map yet, it will be created with its state initially set to True. The \`get_content_of_rectangle\` method sums all the pixel values in the given rectangle (aligned with given range [x1, y1] to [x2, y2]) while ignoring the off pixels. Here is a simplified version of the code to provide an initial implementation for discussion: \`\`\`python class RectangleContent: def __init__(self): self.grid = {} # toggle state at (x, y) def suppress(self, x, y): current_state = self.grid.get((x, y)) # get current state # If the pixel doesn't exist in grid, create it if current_state is None: current_state = 0 # set state to 1 by default # Invert the state new_state = 1 - current_state self.grid[(x, y)] = new_state # count the on pixels in the given rectangle def get_content_of_rectangle(self, x1, y1, x2, y2): count = 0 for x in range(x1, x2 + 1): for y in range(y1, y2 + 1): count += self.grid.get((x, y), 0) return count \`\`\` Note that the usage of a dictionary-based approach would be very memory inefficient for a very large grid size as every single pixel on is separately stored; use a more efficient data structure approach if the grid size is too big.

This problem is known as the Min Cost Climbing Stairs problem. The problem statement requires us to use dynamic programming to solve the problem in the \\"most simple way\\" as indicated by the guidelines. Here's the problem in formal terms: > On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost \`has\` has been assigned (i.e., cost[i] to climb on the step). You can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time from the 0th step to the top. Find the least expensive way to reach one level in the last two different prices you can pay. You can either start at either step 0, or step 1. Given n will be a non-negative integer in the range [0, 1, ..., 3 10^4]. Each element \`cost[i]\` will be an integer in the range [1, 999].
