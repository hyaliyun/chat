The operations supported by the virtual machine are: - `PUSH X` - Pushes the integer `X` onto the stack. - `ADD` - Pops the top two values from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. - `SUB` - Pops the top two values from the stack, subtracts the second popped value from the first, and pushes the result back onto the stack. - `MUL` - Pops the top two values from the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. - `DIV` - Pops the top two values from the stack, divides the first popped value by the second, and pushes the result back onto the stack.

Similarly, she measured the depth of the second section of the sea at n+1, n+2, ldots, n+m meters from the shore and saved them in array d_2. Depth d_{1i} denotes the depth of the sea at i meters from the shore for 1 le i le n, and depth d_{2j} denotes the depth of the sea at n+j meters from the shore for 1 le j le m.

Koa can move at most 1 meter per second forward. She can start swimming at any time she chooses. She can also decide to wait if the current depth is too high. She cannot continue moving if the depth of the current meter of the sea minus tide effect at that point of time exceeds l. Note that while Koa swims, tide doesn\'t have effect on her (i.e., she can\'t drown while swimming).

The service must ensure that events do not share the same event ID. Input consists of a series of commands processed in order. The first input line specifies the total number of commands, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Each of the following n lines contains a command: - Add event: “add <event_id> <start_time> <end_time>” where event_id is a unique identifier, start_time and end_time (1 ≤ start_time < end_time ≤ 10^9) determine the time range of the event. - Remove event: “remove <event_id>” removes the event with the specified event_id. - Query: “query <time>” returns the count of events active at the given time.

The insignia, in the form of a beautiful mosaic, consists of square tiles of different colors. Each tile has a certain beauty score associated with it, and the total beauty of the insignia is the sum of the beauty scores of all the tiles used in the mosaic. There is a catch, however. The insignia must be a perfect rectangle, and not all arrangements of tiles are allowed. To ensure the insignia remains unique and elegant, the university has set three specific constraints on the number of tiles used: 1. The total number of tiles in the insignia must be exactly `n`. 2. The width of the insignia (number of tiles in each row) must be exactly `w`. 3. The height of the insignia (number of tiles in each column) must be exactly `h`, where `h * w = n`.

The tree consists of **N** branches. Each branch has a unique length from 1 to N. The branches are attached to the trunk in such a way that no two branches of the same length will be at the same height. One day, a botanist decided to measure the maximum possible height of this tree by rearranging the branches. The height of the tree is defined as the length of the trunk plus the highest branch height. The tree trunk has a length of **T** and for each branch, the height is directly proportional to its length. For instance, a branch with length **L** will have a height of **L**. To make it clearer, if the trunk has a length of **T** and the highest branch attached to it is of length **N**, the maximum possible height of the tree will be **T + N**. Your task is to compute the maximum possible height of the tree after rearranging the branches in such a way that the longest branch is at the maximum possible height. # Input - The first line contains two integers **N** and **T** (1 ≤ **N**, **T** ≤ 1000) — the number of branches and the length of the trunk, respectively. # Output - Output a single integer — the maximum possible height of the tree. # Example Input ``` 5 10 ``` Output ``` 15 ``` In this example, there are 5 branches and the trunk length is 10.

He wants to determine whether a given string can be converted into a palindrome by removing at most one character. Your task is to write a function that helps John achieve this. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of lowercase English letters. For each test case, print \\"YES\\" if it is possible to make the string a palindrome by removing at most one character. Otherwise, print \\"NO\\". **Examples:** Input: ``` 2 abca racecar ``` Output: ``` YES YES ``` Explanation: - For the first test case, by removing the character \'b\', we get the palindrome \\"aca\\". - For the second test case, the string is already a palindrome, so no characters need to be removed.","solution":"def can_be_palindrome(s): Determine if the string s can be made a palindrome by removing at most one character.

Given the number of intersections n and the number of roads m, along with the details of the closed roads, the company\'s task is to find the minimum number of closed roads that need to be reopened to ensure that the shortest path from the warehouse to each delivery point is not affected. Each road can be reopened and made functional again, but this incurs a cost. The goal is to minimize the reopening cost while ensuring that the shortest paths to all delivery points are achievable. # Input - The first line contains two integers n and m (1 le n, m le 10^5) — the number of intersections and the number of roads. - The next m lines each contain three integers u, v, and w (1 le u, v le n, 1 le w le 1000), denoting a road between intersections u and v with length w. - The next line contains a single integer k (0 le k le 10^5) — the number of closed roads. - The next k lines each contain three integers c_u, c_v, and c_w (1 le c_u, c_v le n, 1 le c_w le 1000), denoting a closed road between intersections c_u and c_v with reopening cost c_w. - The next line contains a single integer d (1 le d le 10^3) — the number of delivery points. - The next line contains d integers, each representing a target node to which the delivery should be made. # Output - The output should be a single integer, denoting the minimum total reopening cost to ensure that the shortest path from the warehouse to each of the target delivery points is accessible. # Example Input ``` 5 6 1 2 3 1 3 7 2 3 3 2 4 2 3 4 5 3 5 6 3 1 4 2 2 3 4 3 5 8 2 4 5 ``` Output ``` 2 ``` # Explanation The city has 5 intersections and 6 roads. The roads between intersections are given with their respective lengths. Three roads are closed, with specified reopening costs. There are two delivery points, intersections 4 and 5. By reopening the first closed road (1, 4) at a cost of 2, the company can ensure the shortest path from the warehouse (intersection 1) to the delivery points is maintained. The other closed roads do not need to be reopened as they don\'t affect the optimal path.

An operation is defined as inserting any single character at any position in the string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, \'abba\' is a palindrome but \'abb\' is not. **Input:** - The input is a single line containing the string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000). The string consists only of lowercase English letters. **Output:** - Output a single integer, the minimum number of insertions needed to make S a palindrome. **Sample Input:** ``` abcaa ``` **Sample Output:** ``` 2 ``` **Explanation:** In the sample, the string \\"abcaa\\" can be transformed into a palindrome by inserting two characters: \'b\' at the end to make it \\"abcaab\\", and then \'c\' at the end again to form \\"abcaabc\\". Therefore, two operations are needed.","solution":"def min_insertions_to_palindrome(S): Returns the minimum number of insertions required to transform S into a palindrome. n = len(S) dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)] for gap in range(1, n): for l in range(n - gap): h = l + gap if S[l] == S[h]: dp[l][h] = dp[l + 1][h - 1] else: dp[l][h] = min(dp[l][h - 1], dp[l + 1][h]) + 1 return dp[0][n - 1]"},{"question":"A cargo ship is navigating through an ocean represented by a 2D grid.

The race track is divided into n segments, each represented by a cell in an array. Some segments are muddy, making them more difficult to traverse.

The track is represented by a string of length n, where characters \\"M\\" (muddy) and \\"C\\" (clear) indicate the state of each segment.
