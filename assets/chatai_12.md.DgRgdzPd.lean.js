At each intersection, traffic from multiple directions converges, and the traffic lights control the flow of all vehicles.

Mathematically, it can be expressed as: ```math F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n geq 2 ``` Traditionally, this sequence is computed using recursive methods, but this approach becomes inefficient for large values of `n` due to overlapping subproblems and stack overflow issues. Therefore, dynamic programming can be applied to improve the efficiency by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them. Task Write a function `fib_dp(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. # Input - An integer `n` (0 ≤ `n` ≤ 1,000,000), representing the position in the Fibonacci sequence. # Output - An integer representing the nth Fibonacci number. # Constraints - Your solution should be able to handle very large input values efficiently. - You must use an iterative dynamic programming approach, avoiding recursion. - Consider the computational limits and potential integer overflow scenarios. # Examples ```python fib_dp(0) should return: 0 fib_dp(1) should return: 1 fib_dp(10) should return: 55 fib_dp(20) should return: 6765 fib_dp(50) should return: 12586269025 fib_dp(1000000) should return some large integer ``` Hints - You can use a list to store intermediate Fibonacci numbers, or you can optimize the space complexity by using only a few variables. - Take advantage of Python’s inherent ability to handle arbitrarily large integers. - Ensure your code runs efficiently even for the upper limit of `n`.

This approach not only helps in reducing time complexity but also ensures that extremely large values are handled efficiently without recursive stack overflow.

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is called a tick. # Task Your task is to create a function called `game_of_life()` that takes a two-dimensional list of integers `grid` representing the state of the grid at a particular tick.

The system maintains a list of student records, where each record is a dictionary containing the keys \'id\', \'name\', and \'score\'. The function takes two arguments: a list of student records and a list of operations. Each operation in the operations list is a tuple where the first element is a string representing the type of operation and the second element is either another tuple or an integer representing the data for the operation. The function should perform each operation sequentially and return the updated list of student records after all operations have been carried out. Valid operations are: - \\"add\\": Add a new student record to the list. The data for this operation is a tuple containing the student\'s id, name, and score. - \\"remove\\": Remove a student record from the list. The data for this operation is the student\'s id. - \\"update\\": Update the score of an existing student. The data for this operation is a tuple containing the student\'s id and the new score. - \\"average\\": Calculate the average score of all students. The data for this operation is an integer representing a threshold score; only students with scores greater than or equal to this threshold are considered. The function should append a dictionary with the key \'average\' and the calculated average as the value to the list of student records and continue with the next operations. Examples: ``` records = [ {\'id\': 1, \'name\': \'Alice\', \'score\': 85}, {\'id\': 2, \'name\': \'Bob\', \'score\': 90}, {\'id\': 3, \'name\': \'Charlie\', \'score\': 78} ] operations = [ (\'add\', (4, \'David\', 88)), (\'remove\', 2), (\'update\', (3, 80)), (\'average\', 80) ] studentManager(records, operations) ``` Expected output: ``` [ {\'id\': 1, \'name\': \'Alice\', \'score\': 85}, {\'id\': 3, \'name\': \'Charlie\', \'score\': 80}, {\'id\': 4, \'name\': \'David\', \'score\': 88}, {\'average\': 84.33} ] ``` The function should handle edge cases such as: - Attempting to remove a student who does not exist in the records. - Updating the score of a student who does not exist. - Calculating the average when no students meet the threshold criteria (should return \'average\': 0).

Additionally, they want to provide some functionalities to query and manipulate the inventory list. # Task: You need to design a class `Inventory` that allows adding and removing cars from their inventory, querying cars using their VIN, and retrieving all cars manufactured in a specific year. # The `Inventory` class should support the following operations: 1. `add_car(vin, model, year)` – Adds a car to the inventory. `vin` is a unique string identifier, `model` is a string representing the car model, and `year` is an integer representing the year of manufacturing. 2. `remove_car(vin)` – Removes the car associated with the given VIN from the inventory. If the car doesn\'t exist, do nothing. 3. `get_car(vin)` – Returns a tuple `(vin, model, year)` if the car with the given VIN exists, otherwise returns `None`. 4. `get_cars_by_year(year)` – Returns a list of tuples `(vin, model, year)` for all cars manufactured in the specified `year`.

Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sorted order. itertools.combinations_with_replacement() This tool returns r length subsequences of elements from the input iterable allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once.

Here are some example scenarios to illustrate how the `MealLog` class should work: ```python # Example Usage meal_log = MealLog() meal_log.add_meal(\\"Salad\\", 150, True) meal_log.add_meal(\\"Burger\\", 500, False) meal_log.add_meal(\\"Smoothie\\", 200, True) assert meal_log.total_calories() == 850 # Total calories are 150 + 500 + 200 all_meals = meal_log.get_meals() # Expected: [{\'name\': \'Salad\', \'calories\': 150, \'is_healthy\': True}, {\'name\': \'Burger\', \'calories\': 500, \'is_healthy\': False}, {\'name\': \'Smoothie\', \'calories\': 200, \'is_healthy\': True}] healthy_meals = meal_log.get_meals(show_healthy=True) # Expected: [{\'name\': \'Salad\', \'calories\': 150, \'is_healthy\': True}, {\'name\': \'Smoothie\', \'calories\': 200, \'is_healthy\': True}] unhealthy_meals = meal_log.get_meals(show_healthy=False) # Expected: [{\'name\': \'Burger\', \'calories\': 500, \'is_healthy\': False}] ``` Implement the `MealLog` class and the required methods to satisfy the above requirements and examples.","solution":"class MealLog: def __init__(self): self.meals = [] def add_meal(self, name: str, calories: int, is_healthy: bool): meal = { \\"name\\": name, \\"calories\\": calories, \\"is_healthy\\": is_healthy } self.meals.append(meal) def total_calories(self): return sum(meal[\\"calories\\"] for meal in self.meals) def get_meals(self, show_healthy: bool=None): if show_healthy is None: return self.meals return [meal for meal in self.meals if meal[\\"is_healthy\\"] == show_healthy]"},{"question":"Write a function named `is_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
