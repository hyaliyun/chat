Each spell is represented by an uppercase English letter and has a specific cost associated with it. A sequence of spells, or a spell sequence, is a string containing one or more of these spell letters. Wizards need to calculate the total cost of casting a spell sequence. The cost of a spell sequence is determined by adding the costs of each individual spell in the sequence. Additionally, wizards have discovered an ancient technique which allows them to apply a series of discounts to reduce the total cost. A discount operates as follows: - It specifies a particular spell and a percentage by which the cost of that spell is reduced whenever it appears in a sequence. For example, a discount could state that the cost of the spell \\"A\\" is reduced by 10%. Your task is to calculate the total cost of casting a given sequence of spells after applying a series of discounts. -----Input----- - The first line contains an integer ( n ) (1 ≤ ( n ) ≤ 100), the number of different spells. - The second line contains ( n ) integers ( c_1, c_2, ..., c_n ) (1 ≤ ( c_i ) ≤ 1000), where ( c_i ) is the cost of the ( i )-th spell. - The third line contains a string ( s ) which represents the sequence of spells. The length of ( s ) is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. - The fourth line contains an integer ( d ) (0 ≤ ( d ) ≤ 26), the number of discounts. - The next ( d ) lines each contain a character and an integer ( p ) (1 ≤ ( p ) ≤ 100), representing the spell and the percentage by which its cost is reduced.

Write a function `can_sort_with_swaps(arr, d)` that takes in an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`, and returns `True` if the array can be sorted under the given constraints, otherwise returns `False`. # Input - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases. - For each test case: - An integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array. - An integer `d` representing the threshold for allowable swaps. - A list of `n` integers representing the array. # Output - For each test case, return `True` or `False`. # Constraints - 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 - 0 ≤ d ≤ 1000 - -1000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000 # Example Input ``` 2 5 3 4 2 3 1 5 4 1 1 5 3 6 ``` Output ``` True False ``` Explanation For the first test case, we can sort the array by the following valid swaps with `d = 3`: - Swap (4, 2) → [2, 4, 3, 1, 5] - Swap (4, 3) → [2, 3, 4, 1, 5] - Swap (4, 1) → [2, 3, 1, 4, 5] - Swap (3, 1) → [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] - Swap (2, 1) → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] For the second test case, it is impossible to sort the array as no valid swaps can rearrange the elements to achieve a non-decreasing order under the constraint `d = 1`.","solution":"def can_sort_with_swaps(arr, d): Function to determine if an array can be sorted with the given swap threshold.

James needs to choose exactly K cards from these N cards such that the total attack value is at least P and the total health value is at least Q.

She is fascinated by the concept of tree traversal and would like to create a problem around it to challenge her classmates. A tree is a connected acyclic graph. In this problem, Mary is focusing on binary trees, where each node has at most two children. The tree traversal she is interested in is an in-order traversal, which visits nodes in the following order: 1. Visit the left subtree. 2. Visit the root. 3. Visit the right subtree. Mary has a binary tree and she needs to find all possible in-order traversals for this tree that would yield a sorted sequence of node values, assuming there could be multiple valid traversals.

Each sector\'s performance is gauged using points, and these tax credits are calculated based on specific rules. The kingdom\'s financial administrator, Eve, needs to implement an algorithm to calculate the total tax credits for each sector. Every sector is represented by a string consisting of the characters \'A\', \'B\', and \'C\', which correspond to different levels of performance: - \'A\' means Excellent performance and grants 5 points - \'B\' means Good performance and grants 3 points - \'C\' means Average performance and grants 1 point The total points for a sector are calculated by summing up the points corresponding to each character in the string. The tax credits are calculated using the total points obtained: - For every 10 points, the sector receives 2 tax credits - For points that do not perfectly divide into groups of 10, any remaining points still grant tax credits based on the ratio of points to tax credits. For example, if a string has a total of 25 points: - 2 tax credits for every 10 points - 5 extra points which should be converted proportionally into tax credits For simplicity, the tax credits should be considered an integer value by truncating the fractional part.

Example Input 3 2 4 healing 10 mana 20 strength 15 speed: healing 1, mana 1 invincibility: strength 1, speed 1 healing mana speed invincibility Output 10 30 50 65 Explanation - After the first brewing step, Alice brews \\"healing\\" (10 power). - After the second brewing step, Alice brews \\"mana\\" (20 power) and her total is now 10 (healing) + 20 (mana) = 30 power. - After the third step, Alice brews \\"speed\\", which is a complex potion made from \\"healing\\" and \\"mana\\". This potion has the combined power value of its components: 10 (healing) + 20 (mana) = 30. Thus, the total power after this step is 30 (previous total) + 30 (speed) = 50 power. - After the fourth step, Alice brews \\"invincibility\\" using \\"strength\\" (15 power) and \\"speed\\" (30 power), resulting in a combined power of 15 + 30 = 45. Adding this to the previous total gives 50 (previous total) + 45 = 95 power.

For each character in the string, calculate the product of its ASCII value (A) and its 1-based position (P) in the string. 2. Sum all these calculated values. 3. Compute the resultant number as the sum modulo `10^9 + 7`. Help Bob implement a function that takes a string `S`, applies the transformation rules, and returns the resultant number.

You start in the top-left corner of the grid and attempt to reach the bottom-right corner by moving only down or right at each step. The task is to determine the number of unique paths that can lead you from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. This problem is an exercise in dynamic programming and combinatorial algorithms. A naive recursive solution may work for small grids but will likely need optimization to handle larger grids efficiently. # Definitions - A grid is represented as a matrix of dimensions `m x n` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. - You start at position `(0,0)` and attempt to reach position `(m-1,n-1)` by moving only down or right at each step. - The number of unique paths from `(0,0)` to `(m-1,n-1)` must be calculated. # Examples Here\'s one way to visualize the paths in a `2x3` grid: Grid: 3 columns x 2 rows [ [\\"S\\", \\".\\", \\".\\"], [\\".\\", \\".\\", \\"E\\"] ] - If `S` is the start cell and `E` is the end cell, there are three unique paths from `S` to `E`: - `Right -> Right -> Down` - `Right -> Down -> Right` - `Down -> Right -> Right` # Input Your function will receive: `unique_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int` # Output Return the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. # Constraints - 1 <= m, n <= 100 - You may not encounter any obstacles in the grid. # Example >>> unique_paths(3, 2) 3 >>> unique_paths(7, 3) 28 # The Algorithm To solve the problem efficiently, it\'s advised to use dynamic programming (DP). Here’s the algorithm outline: 1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m x n`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`. 2. Set the starting position `dp[0][0] = 1` since there\'s exactly one way to stay at the starting point. 3. Iterate through each cell in the grid and update the number of paths to that cell by summing the paths from the cell above and the cell to the left: ```python dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] ``` 4. The answer will be the value in the bottom-right corner of the grid `dp[m-1][n-1]`. # Implementation Example ```python def unique_paths(m, n): # Create a 2D list with all elements initialized to 0 dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)] # There\'s exactly one way to be at the start dp[0][0] = 1 # Populate the DP table for i in range(m): for j in range(n): if i > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] if j > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] # The answer is in the bottom-right corner return dp[m-1][n-1] # Sample outputs for example cases print(unique_paths(3, 2)) # Should output 3 print(unique_paths(7, 3)) # Should output 28 ``` Good luck!","solution":"def unique_paths(m, n): Returns the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right in a m x n grid. # Create a 2D list with all elements initialized to 0 dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)] # There\'s exactly one way to be at the start dp[0][0] = 1 # Populate the DP table for i in range(m): for j in range(n): if i > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] if j > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] # The answer is in the bottom-right corner return dp[m-1][n-1]"},{"question":"Jane needs to organize a series of events, each with different start and end times, but she cannot attend more than one event at a time.

In the second example, the compressed version (`a1b1c1d1e1f1`) is longer than the original string (`abcdef`), hence the original string is returned.","solution":"def compress_string(s): Compresses the string by collapsing repeated characters with their counts.

Among these artifacts, there are coded messages comprised of an array of numbers. To decode these messages, you must reconstruct them using a specific sequence. These messages are hidden inside multiple vaults, and to progress through the cave, you need to determine the correct order for the array elements. Given an array of integers, you need to reorder its elements such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to a specified integer k. If it is possible to reorder the array in such a way, print \\"Reordering is possible.\\" Otherwise, print \\"Reordering is not possible.\\" Input The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T, up to 500) is specified on the first line. Each test case begins with an integer N (2 <= N <= 100,000), representing the number of elements in the array. This is followed by N space-separated integers which make up the array. Finally, an integer k (1 <= k <= 1,000) is given, representing the maximum allowed absolute difference between consecutive elements in the reordered array. Output For each test case, output whether it is possible to reorder the array to satisfy the given condition.
