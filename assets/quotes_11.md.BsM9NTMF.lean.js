For example, if n = 9 and t = [5, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 8, 3], then Polycarp could make the following schedule: Day 1: Attend sessions with duration [5] Day 2: Attend sessions with duration [3] Day 3: Attend sessions with duration [2, 7, 4, 6] Day 4: Attend sessions with duration [5] Day 5: Attend sessions with duration [8] Day 6: Attend sessions with duration [3] Hence, the minimum number of days Polycarp needs is 6. -----Input----- The first line contains an integer t (1 le t le 100).

For this problem, consider each meeting is represented by a pair of integers (s_i, e_i) where s_i is the start time and e_i is the end time of the meeting. Both s_i and e_i are in the range [0, 2400), indicating the minutes elapsed since midnight. One of the key requirements for this task is to determine if the user can attend all meetings without overlaps. -----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 le t le 100) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 le n le 100) — the number of meetings. The following n lines of each test case contain two integers s_i and e_i (0 le s_i < e_i le 2400) — the start and end times of the meetings. -----Output----- For each test case, output one line containing {YES} if it is possible to attend all meetings without any overlaps, and {NO} otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 300 400 700 800 1200 1300 3 300 700 500 800 900 1000 2 0 1440 1440 2400 2 450 600 900 1100 Output YES NO YES YES -----Note----- In the first test case, the meetings occur at non-overlapping times [300, 400], [700, 800], and [1200, 1300]. In the second test case, there is an overlap between meetings [300, 700] and [500, 800], making it impossible to attend all meetings. In the third test case, the meetings occur as [0, 1440] and [1440, 2400] without any overlap. In the fourth test case, the meetings do not overlap as [450, 600] and [900, 1100].","solution":"def can_attend_all_meetings(test_cases): results = [] for n, meetings in test_cases: # Sort meetings by start time meetings.sort() can_attend = True for i in range(1, n): # Check for overlaps if meetings[i][0] < meetings[i-1][1]: can_attend = False break results.append(\\"YES\\" if can_attend else \\"NO\\") return results def process_input(input_data): input_lines = input_data.strip().split(\'n\') t = int(input_lines[0].strip()) index = 1 test_cases = [] for _ in range(t): n = int(input_lines[index].strip()) index += 1 meetings = [] for _ in range(n): s, e = map(int, input_lines[index].strip().split()) meetings.append((s, e)) index += 1 test_cases.append((n, meetings)) return test_cases, t def main(input_data): test_cases, t = process_input(input_data) results = can_attend_all_meetings(test_cases) for result in results: print(result)"},{"question":"A friend of yours, Alex, has a mysterious sequence defined in his notebook.

The polygon is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the `(x, y)` coordinates of a vertex of the polygon. The point to test is a single tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates. The polygon vertices are given in sequence, such that the polygon may be concave or convex, and the vertices are ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise. # Example Consider the following polygon and points: ```plaintext Polygon: [(1,1), (4,1), (4,4), (1,4)] Point: (2,2) -> should return True (inside polygon) Point: (0,0) -> should return False (outside polygon) ``` # Algorithm Outline One widely used algorithm to solve this problem is the Ray Casting algorithm: 1. Draw an imaginary infinite horizontal line to the right of each point and count how many times it intersects with the polygon\'s edges. 2. A point is inside the polygon if and only if this count is odd. If the count is even, the point lies outside. # Function Requirements 1. **Function Signature:** ```python def point_in_polygon(polygon, point): ``` 2. **Parameters:** - `polygon`: A list of tuples representing the vertices of the polygon, e.g., `[(1,1), (4,1), (4,4), (1,4)]`. - `point`: A tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates of the point to be tested, e.g., `(2,2)`. 3. **Return:** - `True` if the point lies inside the polygon. - `False` otherwise. # Additional Constraints - You may assume the polygon is simple (its edges do not intersect except at the vertices). - You may assume the vertices of the polygon are provided in a consistent order (either all clockwise or all counterclockwise). # Examples ```python assert point_in_polygon([(1,1), (4,1), (4,4), (1,4)], (2,2)) == True assert point_in_polygon([(1,1), (4,1), (4,4), (1,4)], (0,0)) == False assert point_in_polygon([(0,0), (5,0), (5,5), (0,5)], (3,3)) == True assert point_in_polygon([(0,0), (5,0), (5,5), (0,5)], (5,5)) == True assert point_in_polygon([(1,2), (3,5), (5,2)], (3,3)) == True assert point_in_polygon([(1,2), (3,5), (5,2)], (3,5)) == False ``` Put on your geometry hat and get coding!","solution":"def point_in_polygon(polygon, point): Determines if a given point is inside a polygon using the Ray Casting algorithm.

Example: ```python import numpy as np A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]]) result_matrix = A * B print(result_matrix) #Output [[ 5 12] [21 32]] sum_elements = np.sum(result_matrix) print(sum_elements) #Output 70 ``` Task You are given two NXmbox{M} integer matrices A and B with space separated elements (N = rows and mbox{M} = columns). Perform element-wise multiplication and print the resulting matrix. Then, print the sum of the elements of the resulting matrix.

She is worried about potential data leaks and wants to ensure that only authenticated messages are sent. She decides to use a combination of encryption and digital signatures to achieve this. To simulate this process, you will write a function to encode a message using encryption and then sign it using a digital signature. Encryption The encryption method Twilight Sparkle uses is a simple XOR cipher with a key. Given a plaintext message and a key, each character in the plaintext is XORed with the corresponding character in the key (repeating the key as necessary). Digital Signature To authenticate the message, we compute a digital signature by simply reversing the encrypted message. This ensures that the integrity of the message can be verified by the recipient. Task Write a function `secure_message(message: str, key: str) -> str` that takes a plaintext message and a key as inputs. The function should return the encrypted message concatenated with its digital signature. * The encrypted message should be generated using the XOR cipher with the provided key. * The digital signature is the reverse of the encrypted message. # Input * `message`: a string of length `1 ≤ len(message) ≤ 100`. * `key`: a string of length `1 ≤ len(key) ≤ 100`. # Output * Return the encrypted message concatenated with its digital signature. # Example Input: ```python secure_message(\\"hello\\", \\"secret\\") ``` Output: ``` \'x1bx02x0cx07x02x02x07x0cx02x1b\' ``` Explanation: 1. Encrypt the message \\"hello\\" using the key \\"secret\\": - XOR \'h\' (104) with \'s\' (115) results in 11 (`x0b`). - XOR \'e\' (101) with \'e\' (101) results in 0 (`x00`). - XOR \'l\' (108) with \'c\' (99) results in 15 (`x0f`). - XOR \'l\' (108) with \'r\' (114) results in 28 (`x1c`). - XOR \'o\' (111) with \'e\' (101) results in 10 (`x0a`). 2. Reverse the encrypted message: - `\'x1bx02x0cx07x02\'` reversed is `\'x02x07x0cx02x1b\'`. 3.

The fourth line contains n strings, each representing a negative word. The fifth line contains an integer r (1 leq r leq 1000), the number of reviews. Each of the following r lines contains a single review which is a sequence of words separated by spaces. Each review contains at most 200 words, and each word in a review is guaranteed to be alphanumeric. Output For each review, output a single line containing \\"Positive\\" if the review contains more positive words than negative words, \\"Negative\\" if it contains more negative words than positive words, or \\"Neutral\\" if the count of positive words equals the count of negative words. Sample Input 5 good excellent fantastic nice great 4 bad terrible awful poor 3 the product is good but the delivery was bad an excellent purchase with fantastic support the quality is awful and the color is terrible Sample Output Neutral Positive Negative Explanation 1.

They need to implement a feature that tracks the inventory of books in various categories. The system needs to be able to add new book entries, update the inventory of existing books, and generate reports by category. The structure of the inventory is as follows: - Each book has a unique identifier (string). - Each book has a title (string). - Each book belongs to a category (string) such as \\"Fiction\\", \\"Non-Fiction\\", \\"Science\\", etc. - Each book has a quantity (integer), which represents how many copies of the book are available in the inventory. Your task consists of implementing the following functions: 1. `add_book(identifier, title, category, quantity)`: Adds a new book to the inventory. 2. `update_inventory(identifier, quantity)`: Updates the quantity of an existing book. If the quantity becomes zero or negative, the book should be removed from the inventory. 3. `generate_report(category)`: Generates a report listing all books in a given category. The report should include the identifier, title, and quantity of each book in the category. The books in the report should be listed in the order they were added to the inventory.
