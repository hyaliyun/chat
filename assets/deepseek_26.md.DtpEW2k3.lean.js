Each Leafaltron has a certain number of leaves, and their health is determined by the energy level of these leaves, which is some positive integer. When a Leafaltron loses a leaf, its overall health decreases proportionally to the energy of that leaf. During the annual celebration, Leafaltrons from different regions gather to exchange leaves. The exchange of leaves between two Leafaltrons of the same region follows certain rules: - A Leafaltron with more leaf energy will lose a leaf to a Leafaltron with less or equal leaf energy from the same region. - The process continues until no more leaves can be exchanged between two Leafaltrons from the same region. Each Leafaltron can be represented by a tuple (R, E), where R signifies the region and E represents the total energy of its leaves. For example, a Leafaltron with 50 units of energy in region 1 can be represented as (1, 50). The celebration aims for a perfect exchange cycle, meaning after the exchanges, every Leafaltron within a region should ideally acquire leaves such that their energy levels are as equal as possible. Your task is to determine the final health status of each Leafaltron after the exchanges. ----Input---- The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with an integer N, the number of Leafaltrons participating in the celebration. Each of the next N lines contains two space-separated integers Ri and Ei, denoting the region and the initial leaf energy of the ith Leafaltron. ----Output---- For each test case, output the final energy levels of Leafaltrons after the leaf exchanges in each region, sorted by the initial order of input. ----Constraints---- - Each integer in the input file is positive and does not exceed 100. - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ Ri, Ei ≤ 100 ----Example---- Input: 2 3 1 30 1 50 1 10 4 2 25 2 75 3 20 3 30 Output: 30 30 30 25 75 25 25 Explanation: Case 1: - Initial Leafaltrons: (1, 30), (1, 50), (1, 10) - After exchanges within region 1: - (30, 50) exchange leaves once since 50 > 30, resulting in (40, 40) - (10, 40) exchange leaves once since 40 > 10, resulting in (20, 30) - Continue the process to achieve as equal energy levels as possible, resulting in (30, 30, 30) Case 2: - Initial Leafaltrons: (2, 25), (2, 75) - After exchanges within region 2: - Since 75 > 25, exchange results in (50, 50) - Initial Leafaltrons: (3, 20), (3, 30) - After exchanges within region 3: - Since 30 > 20, exchange results in (25, 25) Thus the final energies are outputted in the initial input sequence order.","solution":"def leafaltron_exchanges(T, test_cases): This function takes in the number of test cases T and the test cases as input, and returns the final energy levels of Leafaltrons after the leaf exchanges in each region. result = [] for i in range(T): N = test_cases[i][0] leafaltrons = test_cases[i][1] regions = {} for region, energy in leafaltrons: if region not in regions: regions[region] = [] regions[region].append(energy) final_energies = [] for region, energies in regions.items(): total_energy = sum(energies) num_leafaltrons = len(energies) average_energy = total_energy // num_leafaltrons remainder = total_energy % num_leafaltrons balanced_energies = [average_energy] * num_leafaltrons for j in range(remainder): balanced_energies[j] += 1 regions[region] = sorted(balanced_energies) for region, energy in leafaltrons: final_energies.append(regions[region].pop(0)) result.append(final_energies) return result"},{"question":"Two friends, Alice and Bob, like to play a game involving sequences of numbers.

Each employee has a unique employee ID and belongs to one department. Your task is to design a system that receives notifications and efficiently aggregates them into departments, allowing the company to review messages by department. Each notification includes the employee ID and message content. The messages are received one by one. The list of employees and their respective departments will be provided initially. Write a program that: 1. Accepts the list of employees with their departments. 2. Receives a stream of notifications and assigns each message to the corresponding department based on the employee ID. 3. Outputs all aggregated messages for each department. ----- Input ----- The first line contains an integer N (1 le N le 1000) — the number of employees. The next N lines each contain a string emp_id (unique identifier for employee) and a string department separated by a space. Employee ID and department both consist of alphanumeric characters and have no spaces within them. The following line contains an integer M (1 le M le 10,000) — the number of notifications. The next M lines each contain a string emp_id and a string message, separated by a space. Message content will not have spaces. ----- Output ----- For each department that received at least one notification, output the name of the department followed by all messages aggregated in the order they were received. The output should be formatted with the department name on one line, followed by the total number of messages on the next line, and each message on a new line after that. ----- Example ----- Input 3 E101 Sales E102 HR E103 Sales 5 E101 Meeting at 3 PM E103 Report deadline E102 New HR policy E101 Lunch at 12 PM E103 Quarterly results Output Sales 4 Meeting at 3 PM Report deadline Lunch at 12 PM Quarterly results HR 1 New HR policy ----- Note ----- In the example, the first input line indicates there are three employees.

The maze is represented as an `N x N` grid, where walls and open paths are denoted by `1`s and `0`s, respectively. The robots start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and need to reach the bottom-right corner `(N-1, N-1)`. To make the test more challenging, certain cells in the maze contain quantum teleporters. When a robot steps on a quantum teleporter, it transports the robot to another specific cell in the maze instantly. Mission Details --------------- Given a maze represented as a 2D array `maze`, and a dictionary `teleporters` mapping teleportation entry points to their corresponding exits, determine the shortest path for the robot to take from the start to the finish. Example: ```python maze_example = [ [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0] ] teleporters_example = { (0, 0): (2, 1), (1, 3): (3, 3) } ``` In this example: - Starting at `(0, 0)`, the robot gets teleported instantly to `(2, 1)`. - From `(2, 1)`, the robot moves down to `(3, 1)`, and then right to `(3, 2)`, and finally to its destination `(3, 3)`. Therefore, the shortest path length in this example is `4`.

Additionally, instead of defining the next number as the sum of the previous two, you define it using a more complex operation: - The next number is calculated by summing the previous two numbers and then taking the modulo of the result by a given positive integer `m`. For example, given the two initial numbers as 5 and 7, and a modulo `m` of 10, the sequence would proceed as follows: - Start with 5, 7 - Next number: (5+7) % 10 = 2 - Next number: (7+2) % 10 = 9 - Next number: (2+9) % 10 = 1 - and so on... # Function Signature You need to implement the following functions: 1. `generate_sequence(a, b, m, n)`: Generates the first `n` numbers of the modified Fibonacci sequence, starting with `a` and `b`, and using modulo `m` for computing each subsequent number. # Input Format - `a` and `b`: Integers, the first two numbers in the sequence. - `m`: An integer, the modulo to be applied. - `n`: An integer, the number of elements to generate in the sequence. # Output Format - A list of the first `n` elements of the modified Fibonacci sequence. # Examples ```python generate_sequence(5, 7, 10, 5) ``` Output: ```python [5, 7, 2, 9, 1] ``` ```python generate_sequence(0, 1, 100, 10) ``` Output: ```python [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] ``` ```python generate_sequence(4, 9, 3, 7) ``` Output: ```python [4, 9, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2] ``` # Note You can assume that all inputs are valid and that `m` is always a positive integer.","solution":"def generate_sequence(a, b, m, n): Generates the first `n` numbers of a modified Fibonacci sequence.

The warehouse is represented as a grid of cells, where each cell can store a certain number of goods. The warehouse manager needs help in finding the most efficient way to move a specific number of goods from one cell to another. You are given a grid with dimensions `m` x `m`. Each cell in the grid contains some number of goods, represented by a non-negative integer. You are also given a list of `q` queries. Each query specifies two cells in the grid, (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), and the number of goods to be moved from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2). The task is to provide a mechanism that efficiently updates the grid after each query. For each query, if the number of goods to be moved is greater than the number of goods available in the starting cell, no movement should occur, and an \\"Insufficient goods\\" message should be returned. Also, after processing each query, the system should maintain and be able to return the total number of goods in the warehouse. # Input - The first line contains two integers `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) and `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 100), representing the dimensions of the grid and the number of queries, respectively. - The next `m` lines each contain `m` integers, representing the initial number of goods in each cell of the grid. - The following `q` lines each contain four integers `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, `c2`, and an integer `x`, representing a query where `x` goods are moved from cell (r1, c1) to cell (r2, c2). Note that `1 ≤ r1, r2 ≤ m`, `1 ≤ c1, c2 ≤ m`, and `0 ≤ x ≤ 1000`. # Output For each query, output either: - \\"Goods moved\\" (if the goods are successfully moved) - \\"Insufficient goods\\" (if there are not enough goods to move) After processing all queries, output the total number of goods in the warehouse. # Example Input ``` 3 2 10 15 5 7 6 8 9 4 2 1 1 2 3 10 3 3 2 2 3 ``` Output ``` Goods moved Goods moved 66 ``` # Explanation Initially, the warehouse grid is: ``` 10 15 5 7 6 8 9 4 2 ``` - For the first query, moving 10 goods from (1,1) to (2,3): - Cell (1,1) had 10 goods, so the movement is possible. - The new grid will be: ``` 0 15 5 7 6 18 9 4 2 ``` - Output: \\"Goods moved\\" - For the second query, moving 3 goods from (3,3) to (2,2): - Cell (3,3) had 2 goods.

The next n lines contain m characters each — the grid, where \'.\' denotes an empty cell and \'#\' denotes an obstacle. The following line contains four integers sx, sy, tx, ty (1 ≤ sx, sy, tx, ty ≤ 50) — the starting cell (sx, sy) and the target cell (tx, ty). The last line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2500) — the maximum number of moves the drone can make. -----Output----- Print \\"YES\\" if the drone can reach the target cell within k moves, and \\"NO\\" otherwise. You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower). -----Example----- Input 5 5 .#... ...#. .#.#. ...#. ..... 1 1 5 5 10 Output YES Input 5 5 ..... ..... .#. ..... ..... 1 1 5 5 6 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example, the drone can move from (1, 1) to (5, 5) within the given number of moves.

You are provided with an array of strings, where each string is an entry log representing either a person entering or exiting the event. Each log entry is formatted as either \\"enter:UserName\\" or \\"exit:UserName\\". The user names are not case-sensitive but may have leading or trailing spaces, and in some cases, there may be typos causing duplicate entries for the same user. Task 1. Normalize the user names by trimming any leading or trailing spaces and converting them to lowercase. 2. Identify users who were still inside the event after the last log entry. A user is inside the event if they have more \'enter\' logs than \'exit\' logs. 3. Return a sorted list of user names who were still inside. Sample Input ```csharp string[] logs = { \\"enter: Alice \\", \\"ENTER: Bob\\", \\"enter:alice\\", \\"exit: alice\\", \\" exit:BOB\\", \\"Enter:Charlie\\", \\"enter: Alice \\", \\"exit: Charlie\\" }; ``` Expected Output ```csharp List<string> result = new List<string> { \\"alice\\" }; ``` Note - Make sure to handle variations in capitalization and whitespace. - Your output should be a list of user names appearing in sorted order.

Your function will receive one argument - an array of integers `nums`, where the integers can be both positive and negative, and the array can be empty as well. **Example:** ```python unique_combinations([-1,2,2]) ``` Expected output (order of subsets and elements within subsets should be sorted): ```python [ [], [-1], [-1, 2], [-1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2] ] ``` **Function Signature:** ```python def unique_combinations(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]: pass ``` **Hints:** 1. Consider using a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets. 2. You may find it helpful to sort the array at the beginning to handle duplicates effectively. 3. Use a set to avoid adding duplicate combinations.","solution":"from typing import List def unique_combinations(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]: def backtrack(start, path): result.append(path) for i in range(start, len(nums)): if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]: continue backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]]) nums.sort() result = [] backtrack(0, []) return result"},{"question":"Alice and Bob are playing a game on a large, two-dimensional grid.

Your solution should handle expressions containing only non-negative integers and the operators `+` and `*`. 2.

Create a function `is_valid_chess_move(piece, start_position, end_position)` that determines if a move is valid for a given piece. The function should take the following arguments: 1. `piece`: A string, indicating one of the following pieces: \\"king\\", \\"queen\\", \\"rook\\", \\"bishop\\", \\"knight\\", \\"pawn\\". 2. `start_position`: A string, representing the current position on the board (e.g., \'e4\'). 3. `end_position`: A string, representing the new position on the board (e.g., \'e5\'). The chessboard is represented as an 8x8 grid of squares labeled \'a1\' to \'h8\'. The rules for moving pieces are as follows: - **King** can move one square in any direction. - **Queen** can move any number of squares in any direction. - **Rook** can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically. - **Bishop** can move any number of squares diagonally. - **Knight** moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular. - **Pawn** moves one square forward (towards the 8th rank for white, 1st rank for black). On its first move, a pawn can move two squares forward. Pawns cannot move backward. No need to account for the actual state of the board (like other pieces or checks), just focus on individual piece movement validity. Return `True` if the move is valid, and `False` otherwise.
