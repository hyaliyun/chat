Each element in the array represents the change in height between two consecutive hills. Positive numbers indicate an uphill climb (which decreases stamina), and negative numbers indicate a downhill descent (which increases stamina). The stamina decreases by the height difference when going uphill and increases by the height difference when going downhill. Example 1: Input N = 5 H[] = {2, -1, 4, -3, 2} Output 6 Explanation With an initial stamina of 6, the hiker\'s stamina will be as follows: - Start with 6 - 6 - 2 (first uphill) = 4 - 4 + 1 (first downhill) = 5 - 5 - 4 (second uphill) = 1 - 1 + 3 (second downhill) = 4 - 4 - 2 (third uphill) = 2 The stamina never drops below 1.

If ( c ) is zero, it means it is a toll-free road. There can be multiple roads between the same intersections. You need to determine the minimum cost required for a truck to travel from intersection 1 to intersection ( n ). If it is not possible to reach intersection ( n ) from intersection 1, return -1. Input The first line contains two integers ( n ) and ( m ) (2 ≤ ( n ) ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ ( m ) ≤ 10000) — the number of intersections and roads respectively. The next ( m ) lines describe the roads.

The description of each test case is as follows. The first line contains two integers n (1 leq n leq 100) and q (1leq q leq 100) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The second line contains the array of n integers a_i (-100 leq a_i leq 100). The i-th of the next q lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 leq l_i leq r_i leq n) — the range of the query (1-based indexing). -----Output----- For each test case, output q lines. Each line should contain a single integer — the maximum sum of any subarray within the range [l_i, r_i] in the array. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 2 1 -2 3 -1 2 1 3 2 5 3 1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 Output 3 4 -1","solution":"def max_subarray_sum(arr, l, r): max_sum = float(\'-inf\') current_sum = 0 for i in range(l, r + 1): current_sum = max(arr[i], current_sum + arr[i]) max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum) return max_sum def max_sum_queries(t, cases): results = [] for i in range(t): n, q, arr, queries = cases[i] case_result = [] for query in queries: l, r = query l -= 1 # convert to 0-based indexing r -= 1 case_result.append(max_subarray_sum(arr, l, r)) results.append(case_result) return results"},{"question":"Given an array of integers `nums`, you are allowed to choose one set of indices to increment the values by 1.

Each plant has the following attributes: `water_level` (measured in units) and `height` (measured in centimeters). Every day, each plant grows based on the water_level it has. The growth rate is given as a float value, which represents how much a plant\'s height increases for each unit of water it absorbs. Your task is to simulate the growth of a given number of plants over a specified number of days. Implement a function that takes the initial states of the plants, the growth rate, and the number of days to simulate. The function should return the final height of each plant after the simulation period. **Function Signature:** ```python def simulate_growth(initial_states: List[Tuple[int, float]], growth_rate: float, days: int) -> List[float]: ``` **Input:** - `initial_states`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains two values: the initial `water_level` (integer) and the initial `height` (float) of a plant. - `growth_rate`: A float value indicating the daily growth rate per unit of water. - `days`: An integer representing the number of days to simulate the plant growth. **Output:** - Returns a list of floats representing the final height of each plant. **Example:** ```python initial_states = [(3, 10.0), (5, 15.0)] growth_rate = 2.0 days = 3 print(simulate_growth(initial_states, growth_rate, days)) # Output: [22.0, 30.0] ``` **Explanation:** - For the first plant: initially, it has a height of 10.0 cm and absorbs water units for 3 days. Each day it grows `3 * 2.0 = 6.0` cm. After 3 days, the height will be `10.0 + 3 * 6.0 = 28.0` cm. - For the second plant: initially, it has a height of 15.0 cm and absorbs water units for 5 days. Each day it grows `5 * 2.0 = 10.0` cm. After 3 days, the height will be `15.0 + 3 * 10.0 = 45.0` cm. However, it seems like the growth should be accumulated uniformly across the days.

(cycle repeats from node 7) These linked lists do not have cycles: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null Function signature: ```python def has_cycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool: # your code here ``` Where `head` is the reference to the first node in the linked list. **Notes:** - Implement the function to run in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. - You are encouraged to use the Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm for detecting cycles. - You may assume the linked list consists of nodes defined by the class `ListNode`, where each node has an integer value and a reference to the next node (or `null` if it is the last node). Example: ```python class ListNode: def __init__(self, value=0, next=None): self.value = value self.next = next # Example 1: # Creating a linked list with a cycle: # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 ... node1 = ListNode(1) node2 = ListNode(2) node3 = ListNode(3) node4 = ListNode(4) node1.next = node2 node2.next = node3 node3.next = node4 node4.next = node2 # cycle here assert has_cycle(node1) == True # Example 2: # Creating a linked list without a cycle: # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null node1 = ListNode(1) node2 = ListNode(2) node3 = ListNode(3) node4 = ListNode(4) node1.next = node2 node2.next = node3 node3.next = node4 assert has_cycle(node1) == False ```","solution":"class ListNode: def __init__(self, value=0, next=None): self.value = value self.next = next def has_cycle(head): Detects whether a linked list has a cycle using Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm. :param head: ListNode | The head node of the linked list :return: bool | True if there is a cycle, False otherwise if not head or not head.next: return False slow = head fast = head while fast and fast.next: slow = slow.next fast = fast.next.next if slow == fast: return True return False"},{"question":"Emma is an aspiring software engineer.

The maximum difference is 7 - 0 = 7. - If we demolish the building of height 7, the heights become [2, 3, 1, 0, 5]. The maximum difference is 5 - 0 = 5. - By analyzing all cases, the maximum possible difference is obtained by demolishing the building of height 1 (2nd building from the left), resulting in a difference of 6. In the second test case: - No matter which building we demolish, all buildings have the same height of 5. The difference will always be 0. In the third test case: - If we demolish one of the buildings of height 1, the maximum difference is 10 - 0 = 10. - If we demolish the building of height 10, the heights become [1, 1, 0]. The maximum difference is 1 - 0 = 1. - The maximum possible difference is 9, achieved by demolishing one of the buildings with height 1.","solution":"def max_possible_difference(T, test_cases): results = [] for case in test_cases: N, heights = case if N == 2: results.append(abs(heights[0] - heights[1])) else: max_height = max(heights) second_max_height = sorted(heights)[-2] min_height = min(heights) second_min_height = sorted(heights)[1] result = max(max_height - min_height, second_max_height - min_height, max_height - second_min_height) results.append(result) return results"},{"question":"Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding the longest word in the structure which can be built one character at a time by other words in the data structure.

The system works with a set of servers, each assigned to an employee. Messages need to be sent between employees through these servers. Each server has a unique load capacity that indicates the maximum number of messages it can handle at any one time. The communication protocol works as follows: - Any employee can initiate a message and send it to another employee. - Any server that handles a message will immediately route it to its destination server. - If a server exceeds its load capacity, it cannot handle any more messages until some are completed. Furthermore, the system has a unique feature where some messages have priorities. Higher priority messages must be delivered first, relying on the load capacities of the servers. If multiple messages have the same priority, they can be processed in any order.

For example, if S = \\"abbac\\", the substring from position 2 to 4 is \\"bba\\" and the frequencies of \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\' are [1, 2, 0], so the answer is \\"NO\\" since the frequency of \'a\' is not an even number. ------ Input ------ The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the length of the string S. The second line contains the string S. The third line contains a single integer Q. Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query. ------ Output ------ For each query, print \\"YES\\" if the frequency of each letter in the substring S[L:R] is either 0 or an even number, otherwise print \\"NO\\". ------ Constraints ------ 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5} 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^{5} 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N S consists of lowercase English letters \'a\' to \'z\' only. ------ Sample Input 1 ------ 5 ababa 3 1 2 1 5 2 4 ------ Sample Output 1 ------ YES NO YES ------ Explanation 1 ------ For the first query, the substring \\"ab\\" has frequencies [1, 1], which are not even, so the answer is \\"NO\\". For the second query, the substring \\"ababa\\" has frequencies [3, 2], and since 3 is not even, the answer is \\"NO\\". For the third query, the substring \\"bab\\" has frequencies [1, 2], which are not even, so the answer is \\"NO\\".","solution":"def analyze_frequencies(N, S, Q, queries): # Create a prefix frequency array for counts of each character prefix_freq = [[0]*26 for _ in range(N+1)] for i in range(1, N+1): prefix_freq[i] = prefix_freq[i-1][:] pos = ord(S[i-1]) - ord(\'a\') prefix_freq[i][pos] += 1 results = [] for L, R in queries: freq = [prefix_freq[R][i] - prefix_freq[L-1][i] for i in range(26)] result = \\"YES\\" for f in freq: if f % 2 != 0: result = \\"NO\\" break results.append(result) return results"},{"question":"You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

When a laser is fired, it reduces the strength of all obstacles in its path by 1 unit. If the strength of an obstacle reaches zero, the obstacle is eliminated from the grid. The objective of the game is to eliminate all obstacles on the grid using the minimum number of laser shots. Additionally, if an obstacle\'s strength is reduced to zero by a laser shot, it will not affect other obstacles in that same shot. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of laser shots required to clear all obstacles from the grid. However, if it is not possible to clear all obstacles, output -1. Input: The input starts with a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10), representing the size of the grid. The next N lines each contain N nonnegative integers representing the initial grid with obstacle strengths (≤ 10). A value of 0 indicates that there is no obstacle at that cell. Output: Output the minimum number of laser shots required to eliminate all obstacles on the grid. If it is not possible, output -1.

The kingdom is divided into N towns, connected by M bidirectional roads. Every road has a certain travel time associated with it. The postal system needs to deliver letters from a central town (town 1) to all other towns in the kingdom.

A project is considered for approval if both of the following conditions are met: - The budget does not exceed 100,000. - The number of working days required does not exceed 200. Write a program that determines whether a project is approved or not based on the given criteria. ------ Input Format ------ - The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. - Each of the next T lines will contain two integers, B and D — the budget and the number of working days required for the project. ------ Output Format ------ For each test case, output on a new line, APPROVED, if the project meets the criteria, and REJECTED otherwise. You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase.
