Specifically, it leverages a max heap for ascending order sorting (or a min heap for descending order sorting). Your task is to implement a function `heap_sort(arr)` that sorts an input array of integers in-place using the max heap approach. Here are the steps to implement heap sort: 1. **Build a max heap:** This involves rearranging the array such that it becomes a max heap where the largest value is at the root node. 2. **Heapify:** This is a function to maintain the heap property for a given subtree. If the subtree rooted at a node violates the heap property (a parent node is smaller than its children), this function fixes the violation. 3. **Extract elements:** Swap the root (maximum value) of the heap with the last element of the array. Reduce the size of the heap by one, then heapify the root element again to restore the heap property. Repeat this process until the heap is empty. **Function Signature:** ```python def heap_sort(arr: List[int]) -> None: ``` **Explanation of the iterative method:** - **Build Max Heap:** Adjust the array so that the subtree rooted at each non-leaf node satisfies the max heap property. - **Heapify:** Ensure that a subtree rooted with a node `i` of a given array `arr` of size `n` maintains the max heap property. - **Extract elements:** Continuously swap the root of the heap with the last element in the heap, decrease heap size by `1`, and heapify the root. **Detailed Steps:** 1. Define a heapify function that takes an array `arr`, the size of the heap `n`, and the index `i`: - Let `largest` be `i`. Let `left` and `right` be the indices of the left and right children of `i` respectively. - If `left` is within the bounds of the heap and `arr[left] > arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `left`. - Similarly, if `right` is within the bounds of the heap and `arr[right] > arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `right`. - If `largest` is not equal to `i`, swap `arr[i]` with `arr[largest]` and recursively heapify the affected subtree. 2. Build the max heap: - Start from the last non-leaf node and call heapify for each node up to the root node. 3. Perform heap sort: - Swap the root element with the last element, reduce heap size by one, and call heapify for the root node. - Repeat until the entire array is sorted. **Example:** ```python arr = [4, 10, 3, 5, 1] heap_sort(arr) print(arr) # Expected output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10] ``` Below is the implementation of the `heap_sort` function: ```python from typing import List def heapify(arr: List[int], n: int, i: int) -> None: largest = i left = 2 * i + 1 right = 2 * i + 2 if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]: largest = left if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]: largest = right if largest != i: arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i] heapify(arr, n, largest) def heap_sort(arr: List[int]) -> None: n = len(arr) for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1): heapify(arr, n, i) for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1): arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] heapify(arr, i, 0) ```","solution":"from typing import List def heapify(arr: List[int], n: int, i: int) -> None: largest = i left = 2 * i + 1 right = 2 * i + 2 if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]: largest = left if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]: largest = right if largest != i: arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i] heapify(arr, n, largest) def heap_sort(arr: List[int]) -> None: n = len(arr) for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1): heapify(arr, n, i) for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1): arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] heapify(arr, i, 0)"},{"question":"Time Series Anomaly Detection In this problem, you are required to implement a function `detect_anomalies` that utilizes the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect anomalies in a given pandas DataFrame containing time series data. **Function Signature:** ```python def detect_anomalies(df: pd.DataFrame, column: str) -> pd.DataFrame: ``` **Parameters:** - `df` (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing the time series data. - `column` (str): The name of the column in the DataFrame which contains the data for anomaly detection. **Returns:** - `pd.DataFrame`: A new DataFrame with an additional column named \'anomaly\'.

This system should allow the user to add, remove, and update the quantity of items in the inventory through a menu-driven interface. Additionally, the system should be able to display the current inventory in a formatted manner. You need to implement a function named `manage_inventory` which fulfills the following requirements: 1. Continuously displays a menu to the user and performs actions based on user input until the user chooses to exit. 2.
