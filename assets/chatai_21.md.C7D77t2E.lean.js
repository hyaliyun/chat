He has a collection of hiking trails he plans to explore. Each trail has a specific difficulty rating, and Karl wants to hike in a way that minimizes his fatigue over the course of his adventure. He decided that he would alternate between easy and hard trails, starting with an easy trail on the first day and following that with a hard trail the next day, and so on. Karl has two lists of trails: a list of easy trails and a list of hard trails. Each trail has a difficulty rating, and Karl\'s fatigue for any trail is directly proportional to its difficulty rating. Karl will hike one trail per day for a total of `m` days. If there are not enough trails in one category (either easy or hard), Karl will reuse the trails in the same order. Determine the order of trails Karl should take to minimize his total fatigue over `m` days. The first line contains two integers `m` and `n` (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000) — the number of days Karl will hike and the total number of trails available in both lists combined.

Bob can use each type of question at most `k/2` times. Given the array and the integer `x`, determine if Bob can correctly guess `x` with the allowed number of questions or not. # Input - The first line contains three integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 20), and `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). - The second line contains `n` integers, representing the elements of the array. # Output - Print \\"YES\\" if Bob can guarantee to determine the value of `x` with `k` questions and the constraints provided, otherwise print \\"NO\\". # Example Example 1 Input: ``` 5 4 3 1 3 5 7 9 ``` Output: ``` YES ``` Example 2 Input: ``` 5 3 2 1 3 5 7 9 ``` Output: ``` NO ``` # Explanation - In the first example, Bob can ask, for instance, if `x` is in the sub-array `[1:5]`, then if `x` is in `[1:3]`, effectively reducing the possible positions of `x` quickly. - In the second example, in order to uniquely identify `x` as `2`, Bob can\'t ask enough meaningful questions within the limit of 3 due to the constraints.

If no such substring exists, return `-1`. **Example:** ```python assert shortest_nice_substring(\\"abacbc\\") == 3 assert shortest_nice_substring(\\"aabbcc\\") == 4 assert shortest_nice_substring(\\"abc\\") == 3 assert shortest_nice_substring(\\"aabb\\") == -1 ```","solution":"def shortest_nice_substring(s: str) -> int: from collections import Counter if len(set(s)) < 3: return -1 min_length = float(\'inf\') n = len(s) for i in range(n): count = Counter() for j in range(i, n): count[s[j]] += 1 if all(count[char] > 0 for char in \'abc\'): min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1) break return min_length if min_length != float(\'inf\') else -1"},{"question":"In the kingdom of Atlandia, there is a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. The lake has a unique feature where mystical fish appear at exact integer depths. There are n unique depths in the lake where different types of mystical fish appear, and each depth is measured from the surface of the lake. The depths are represented as an array d of length n, where d[i] is the depth at which the i-th type of fish appears. Each type of fish has a maturity level which is defined as the depth at which it appears, meaning the fish at depth di has a maturity level di. A fisherman named Gargy wants to catch the two most mature types of fish. However, his net can only be lowered to the minimum and maximum heights in a single attempt. Therefore, Gargy needs to determine the minimum range of depths he needs to cover in order to catch the two most mature types of fish. Given the depths at which different types of fish appear, help Gargy determine the minimum range of depths he needs to cover to catch the two most mature types of fish. Input: - The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. - Each of the next 2 * t lines contains: - The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of different depths. - The second line contains n distinct integers d1, d2, …, dn (1 ≤ di ≤ 10000) — the depths at which the fish appear. Output: - For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum range of depths Gargy needs to cover to catch the two most mature types of fish. Example: ``` Input: 3 5 200 1000 500 700 800 3 50 150 200 4 300 100 400 200 Output: 200 150 300 ``` Explanation of the Example: - In the first test case, the depths are [200, 1000, 500, 700, 800]. The two most mature depths are 1000 and 800, so the minimum range is 1000 - 800 = 200. - In the second test case, the depths are [50, 150, 200]. The two most mature depths are 200 and 150, so the minimum range is 200 - 150 = 50. - In the third test case, the depths are [300, 100, 400, 200]. The two most mature depths are 400 and 300, so the minimum range is 400 - 300 = 100.","solution":"def minimum_range_to_catch_most_mature_fish(t, test_cases): results = [] for i in range(t): n = test_cases[i][0] depths = test_cases[i][1] # Sort depths to find the two largest sorted_depths = sorted(depths) max_depth = sorted_depths[-1] second_max_depth = sorted_depths[-2] # The minimum range to cover to catch two most mature types of fish min_range = max_depth - second_max_depth results.append(min_range) return results"},{"question":"There are n islands in the sea.

Your task is to determine if the current layout of islands and bridges meets this requirement. You need to write a program that reads the number of islands and bridges, the bridges information, and outputs whether the protection requirement is met or not. If the requirement is not met, the president wants to know the minimum number of bridges that need to be added to satisfy the requirement.

The total penalty time for a problem is calculated as the time taken to solve it plus a fixed penalty for each incorrect submission.
