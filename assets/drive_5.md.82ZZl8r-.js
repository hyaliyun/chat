Admins must be able to review, manage, and respond to reports and feedback. Requirement Pool ```python [ (\\"User report functionality\\", \\"P0\\"), (\\"User feedback functionality\\", \\"P0\\"), (\\"Admin report management\\", \\"P1\\"), (\\"Admin feedback management\\", \\"P1\\") ] ``` UI Design draft The report button should be placed prominently on the stream page. The feedback form should be accessible from the user\'s profile. Admins should have a separate interface to review and manage reports and feedback. Implementation approach We will extend the current Flask application by adding new models, forms, and views. For real-time administration, we will integrate an admin panel accessible only to users with admin privileges.

Product Goals ```python [ \\"Create a CLI rupee collector game\\", \\"Ensure the game has 5 distinct levels\\", \\"Ensure the game is engaging and fun for users\\" ] ``` User Stories ```python [ \\"As a user, I want to collect rupees in different levels using command line inputs\\", \\"As a user, I want each level to offer a unique challenge so that the game remains interesting\\", \\"As a user, I want to be able to save my progress so I can continue where I left off\\", \\"As a user, I want to see my score and level progress in the CLI\\", \\"As a user, I want the game to have a simple and intuitive command system\\" ] ``` Requirement Analysis The product should be a CLI-based rupee collector game with 5 distinct levels. The game should have a simple and intuitive command system, allowing users to navigate the character through different levels. Each level should offer a unique challenge to keep the game engaging. Users should be able to save their progress, see their score and level progress in the CLI. Requirement Pool ```python [ (\\"Create a CLI for user input and game output\\", \\"P0\\"), (\\"Develop 5 distinct levels with unique challenges\\", \\"P0\\"), (\\"Implement a scoring system and display it in the CLI\\", \\"P1\\"), (\\"Implement a save and load game feature\\", \\"P1\\"), (\\"Ensure the command system is simple and intuitive\\", \\"P0\\") ] ``` UI Design draft The UI will be text-based in the CLI. The game area will be represented with ASCII characters. The character\'s position, rupees, and obstacles will be represented by different characters. User\'s score, current level, and commands will be displayed at the top of the CLI. The command input will be at the bottom. Implementation approach We will use Python\'s built-in libraries like `os` for file handling (save/load game), `pickle` for object serialization/deserialization, and `random` for generating random obstacles/rupees. For the game logic, we will create classes for the Game, Level, Player, Obstacle, and Rupee. Each level will have a unique set of obstacles and rupees. The player will navigate the character using simple commands like \'move left\', \'move right\', \'collect\', etc. The game will be turn-based, i.e., the player makes a move, then the game updates the state of the level (like moving obstacles). The game state (current level, score, etc.) will be saved after each turn.

Member Management with functionalities to register new members and update or remove existing ones. 4. Borrowing Section to facilitate the borrowing and returning of books. 5. Reports Section to view and download reports. Anything UNCLEAR The scope of reports and the types of analytics expected need further clarification. --- Implementation approach We will use the Django framework to build the Library Management System. Django\'s Model-View-Template architecture and built-in ORM make it an ideal choice for handling our data models and views efficiently. Django\'s authentication system also simplifies user management and security. For the front end, Django templates will be used initially, with potential enhancements using React.js for a more dynamic user experience.
