Data Storage: # - List: A list is an ordered collection of elements, and it stores the elements in a sequence. # - Dictionary: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. # 2. Accessing Elements: # - List: Elements are accessed by their index, which indicates their position within the sequence. # Example: my_list[0] (accesses the first element). # - Dictionary: Elements are accessed by their unique key. # Example: my_dict['key'] (accesses the value associated with 'key'). # 3. Performance: # - List: Index-based access is O(1), but the insertion and deletion of elements (especially not at the end) can be O(n). # - Dictionary: Key-based access, insertions, and deletions are average O(1). # 4. Use Cases: # - Use a list when you need a simple ordered collection of items where the order matters. # - Use a dictionary when you need a mapping of unique keys to values and need fast lookups by key. # Code Examples: my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] print(my_list[1]) # Outputs: banana my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'Wonderland'} print(my_dict['name']) # Outputs: Alice # Demonstrating Polymorphism: def process_data(data): Processes the data differently based on whether it is a list or a dictionary. if isinstance(data, list): return [element.upper() for element in data] elif isinstance(data, dict): return {key: value.upper() for key, value in data.items()} else: raise TypeError('Unsupported data type') # Example usage: example_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] example_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'Wonderland'} print(process_data(example_list)) # Outputs: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY'] print(process_data(example_dict)) # Outputs: {'name': 'ALICE', 'city': 'WONDERLAND'}"},{"question":"Create a function in Python that takes a list of numbers and removes all elements that occur more than once.","solution":"def remove_duplicates(lst): Returns a list where all elements that occur more than once are removed from the input list.
