Your task is to determine the minimum difficulty level for a contestant to be among the top K contestants using this tie-breaking rule. Example 1: Input: N = 4 K = 2 solutions = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3]] difficulties = [3, 5, 7, 10] Output: 17 Explanation: - Contestant 1 solved problems: [1, 2, 3] with total difficulty: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 - Contestant 2 solved problems: [2, 4] with total difficulty: 5 + 10 = 15 - Contestant 3 solved problems: [1, 3, 4] with total difficulty: 3 + 7 + 10 = 20 - Contestant 4 solved problems: [2, 3] with total difficulty: 5 + 7 = 12 Since K = 2, the top 2 contestants are Contestant 3 and Contestant 1 (due to tie-breaking by difficulty). Thus, the minimum difficulty level to be among the top 2 contestants is 15. Example 2: Input: N = 3 K = 1 solutions = [[1], [2], [3]] difficulties = [4, 5, 6] Output: 6 Explanation: - Contestant 1 solved problems: [1] with total difficulty: 4 - Contestant 2 solved problems: [2] with total difficulty: 5 - Contestant 3 solved problems: [3] with total difficulty: 6 Since K = 1, only the top 1 contestant will receive the prize, which is Contestant 3. Thus, the minimum difficulty level to be the top 1 contestant is 6. Your Task: You don\'t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `minimum_difficulty` which takes an integer N, an integer K, a 2-d array solutions (where each element is a list of problems solved by a contestant), and an array difficulties of length N representing the difficulty of each problem, and returns the minimum difficulty level to be among the top K contestants.

Given the weights and values of the goods, he needs a way to maximize the profit while keeping the total weight of the carried goods under or equal to the cart’s weight capacity. **Task:** Write a program to help the merchant decide which goods to take to maximize profit. You will be given a list of goods, where each good has a weight and a value, and the maximum weight capacity of the cart. **Input:** - The first line contains an integer t (1 le t le 10), the number of test cases. - For each test case: - The first line contains two integers n (1 le n le 100) and W (1 le W le 1000), representing the number of goods and the weight capacity of the cart, respectively. - The next n lines each contain two integers w_i and v_i (1 le w_i le 1000, 1 le v_i le 1000), representing the weight and value of the i-th good. **Output:** For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum profit the merchant can achieve without exceeding the weight capacity of the cart. **Example:** **Input:** ``` 2 4 50 10 60 20 100 30 120 40 240 3 55 25 120 30 140 35 160 ``` **Output:** ``` 360 280 ``` **Explanation:** In the first test case, the merchant can take the goods with weights 10, 20, and 30, which gives a total weight of 10+20+30=60, exceeding the limit.

Alex wants to organize his stamp collection in the album so that he maximizes the number of stamps he can fit into the album\'s slots. However, there is a catch. The shapes of the slots are not given in a straightforward manner. Instead, they are described symbolically through a list of pairs. Each pair indicates that two slots have shapes that can interchangeably fit a particular stamp. You need to help Alex find the maximum number of stamps he can organize in his album. Input The input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10000) — the number of slots in the album and the number of pairs of interchangeable shapes, respectively. The next m lines contain pairs of integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n), indicating that slot ui and slot vi have shapes that can interchangeably fit a stamp.

Similarly, slots 4 and 5 have interchangeable shapes. However, these two groups cannot interchange between the groups, so Alex can only fit 3 stamps in these slots.

One operation he particularly enjoys is reversing substrings. Given a binary string s consisting of characters \'0\' and \'1\' only, John wants to transform the string into a string of all \'1\'s by selecting any substring and reversing it. Help John by finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve his goal. A substring is a contiguous portion of the string, and reversing a substring means reading its elements from end to start, and replacing the original substring with this reversed version.

The cipher must be bijective, meaning each character maps uniquely to another character and there are no conflicts. Alice needs your help to verify if a given substitution cipher is bijective.

Each line represents a tweet message, which contains a sequence of words. A word is a string of characters separated by spaces. A hashtag is defined as any word that starts with the character \'#\'. The input continues until the end-of-file (EOF) marker. The first line of the input will be an integer K, representing the number of top hashtags you need to identify. Output For each test case, output the top K hashtags in separate lines. If there are fewer than K unique hashtags, output all of them. If there are ties (i.e., multiple hashtags have the same frequency), list them in lexicographical order. Example Input 3 #love #happy #love #happy #joy #joy #blessed #love #happy Output #love #happy #joy Explanation In this example, the hashtags \\"#love\\" and \\"#happy\\" both appear 3 times, while \\"#joy\\" appears 2 times, and \\"#blessed\\" appears only once.

A tree in this context is defined as an acyclic connected graph. This tree has some nodes which are colored either red or blue. Alice and Bob have come up with a game that they play on this tree.

The game continues until no more valid nodes can be selected. 4. A move is valid if: - The selected node shares a common edge with at least one previously selected node. - The node has not been selected in any previous move. The winner is determined by the total number of red and blue nodes each player has selected. If Bob has selected more red nodes than Alice, Bob wins.

A palindromic string is a string that reads the same backward as forward. If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same length, return the first one that appears. A naive solution would involve checking all substrings of the given string to see if they are palindromic, which can be time-consuming for large strings. Instead, implement an efficient solution using dynamic programming. Dynamic Programming Approach: 1. Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome. 2. Iterate through possible substring lengths and update the `dp` array accordingly. 3. Find the longest substring that is a palindrome using the `dp` array. Here is a pseudo code to help you: 1. Initialize `n` as the length of the input string. 2. Create a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `[n][n]` initialized to `False`. 3. For every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, set `dp[i][i] = True` (Each character is a palindrome of length 1). 4. Initialize `start` and `max_length` to keep track of the starting index and length of the longest palindromic substring found. 5. Iterate over substring lengths from `2` to `n`. 1. For each substring length `length`, iterate from `start = 0` to `n - length`. 2. For each `start`, calculate `end` as `start + length - 1`. 3. If the characters at `start` and `end` are the same and `dp[start+1][end-1]` is `True` (or the length of substring is `2`), then set `dp[start][end]` to `True`. 4. Update `start` and `max_length` if the current palindromic substring is longer than the previously recorded one. 6. Return the substring from `start` to `start + max_length`. Input - A single string `s` of length between `1` and `1000` containing only lowercase English letters. Output - The longest palindromic substring in the input string.

Elements can be chosen multiple times. - Once T = P or T = Q, the player who performed the operation resulting in T being P or Q wins the game. - If the game lasts for 10^{10} turns, they decide the game ends in a tie.

Your Mission You need to help Flash by writing a function that will calculate the difference in minutes between two given times of the day. Your function will receive two strings representing the start time and the end time in the format \\"HH:MM\\". The start time will always be earlier than the end time within the same day.
