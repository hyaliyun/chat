Routing # Flask provides a \`route\` decorator to bind a function to a URL.

The structure should look something like this: my_package/ ├── my_package/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── module1.py │ └── module2.py ├── setup.py └── README.md 2. **Write the \`__init__.py\` File** - You can leave this file empty or use it to initialize your package and specify what gets imported when your package is imported. 3. **Write the \`setup.py\` Script** - This is the most crucial file for packaging. Below is an example of a basic \`setup.py\` script: from setuptools import setup, find_packages setup( name=\\"my_package\\", version=\\"0.1.0\\", packages=find_packages(), install_requires=[ # List of package dependencies ], author=\\"Your Name\\", author_email=\\"your.email@example.com\\", description=\\"A simple description of your package\\", long_description=open('README.md').read(), long_description_content_type='text/markdown', # Indicates the README is in Markdown url=\\"http://github.com/yourusername/my_package\\", classifiers=[ \\"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\\", \\"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\\", \\"Operating System :: OS Independent\\", ], python_requires='>=3.6', ) 4. **Add a \`README.md\` File** - This file can contain a detailed description of your package, installation instructions, usage examples, etc. 5. **Creating Additional Metadata Files (Optional)** - \`LICENSE\`: If you want to specify a license for your package. - \`.gitignore\`: To ignore files that should not be included in version control. - \`MANIFEST.in\`: To include static files in your package that are not automatically included by \`setuptools\`. 6. **Building and Distributing the Package** - Install the latest versions of \`setuptools\` and \`wheel\`: pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel - Run the following command to build your package: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel - This creates a \`dist\` directory with \`.tar.gz\` and \`.whl\` files. - You can upload your package to PyPI using \`twine\`: pip install twine twine upload dist/* By following these steps, you will be able to create and distribute your own Python package using \`setuptools\`. return guide"},{"question":"Can you help me write a Python script that reads a configuration file in YAML format and uses its values to configure a logging system?
