Their path is represented by an array of integers where each integer denotes the height of the terrain at that point. The height difference between two adjacent points is the difficulty of crossing that terrain. For instance, if the terrain heights are `[h1, h2, ..., hn]`, the difficulty between points `i` and `i+1` is `|hi - hi+1|`. Due to the fitness level of the hikers, they can only traverse a maximum difficulty of `k` between two adjacent points. If at any point the difficulty exceeds `k`, the hikers need to adjust their path such that the difficulty between all the points is within the allowed limit by modifying the height of some of the points. You are to determine the minimum number of modifications required to ensure that the difficulty between all adjacent points is within the limit `k`. # Input The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000) — the number of points in the path and the maximum allowed difficulty.

One key aspect of the system is to balance the load among servers while also being able to quickly recover data if a server goes down. You are tasked with writing a function to simulate the load distribution among servers and calculate the reliability of the system. The function should take into account the number of servers, the dataset sizes, and how data is replicated across servers to enhance reliability. Each server can store a certain amount of data, and each piece of data should be replicated onto a specific number of different servers to ensure it can still be retrieved if some servers fail. The reliability of the system is quantified based on the minimum number of servers that need to fail before any piece of data becomes irretrievable.

Each branch is a sequence of commits represented as strings. Occasionally, a developer may need to merge two branches. During a merge, conflicts may arise if both branches have commits that modify the same file. The goal is to simulate the branching and merging process and determine the number of conflicts during a merge. Each commit in the branches is represented as a string containing the filename and a unique identifier. A conflict occurs if two branches have commits with the same filename but different unique identifiers. Merging should minimize the number of conflicts by choosing the lexicographically smaller unique identifier when possible. Input - The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of branches. - The second line contains n integers, where each integer li (1 ≤ li ≤ 100000) represents the number of commits in branch i. - The following n lines, each contains li strings, representing the commits in branch i. - The next line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) — the number of merge queries. - The following m lines, each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), representing a merge query between branch u and branch v.

Given a road network of cities and the amount of traffic on each road, write a program to calculate the congestion index. The congestion index is defined as the sum of the traffic amounts on the top K most congested roads. Input The input is provided in the following format: N M K a1 b1 t1 a2 b2 t2 :: aM bM tM The first row contains three integers N, M, and K, where: - N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) indicates the number of cities. - M (1 ≤ M ≤ 5000) indicates the number of roads. - K (1 ≤ K ≤ M) indicates the number of top congested roads to consider for the congestion index. The next M rows each contain three integers ai, bi, and ti (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ N and ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), describing a road connecting cities ai and bi with a traffic amount of ti. Output The output is: - A single integer representing the congestion index.

The building has `n` floors, and `m` elevators, and receives a list of floor requests from the occupants. Each request is a tuple `(s, d)` where `s` is the starting floor and `d` is the destination floor. The objective is to assign requests to elevators such that the total number of stops made by all elevators is minimized while ensuring each request is serviced. A stop is defined as a floor where an elevator either picks up passengers or lets them off. If an elevator is assigned to service a request from floor `s` to floor `d`, it counts as two stops – one at floor `s` and one at floor `d`.

You need to help automate the commission calculations based on the sales data of salespeople. Each salesperson belongs to exactly one of the categories: Top, Good, and Average, denoted by `T`, `G`, and `A` respectively. The rules for calculating commission are as follows: 1.

The file system should be able to manage files efficiently by implementing a hierarchical directory structure. Each file or directory is identified by a unique path. The file system supports creating directories, creating files, moving files, and querying the size of directories. Here are the specific operations supported: 1. `mkdir <path>`: Create a new directory at the specified path. All intermediate directories in the path must be created if they do not exist. 2. `add <path> <size>`: Create a new file at the specified path with a size, if the path does not exist, return `Error`. 3. `mv <srcPath> <destPath>`: Move a file from the source path to the destination path. If the file or destination does not exist, return `Error`. 4. `size <path>`: Return the total size of the directory specified by the path, which includes all files recursively under that directory. If the path does not exist, return `Error`. The file system operates from an initially empty state, with no directories or files. Input: - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), the number of operations to be performed. - Each of the next `t` lines describes one of the four operations described above.

There are `N` potion ingredients labeled from `1` to `N`. Each ingredient has a particular magic effect value associated with it on a particular day, which changes every day according to a specific pattern. The wizard records the effect value of each ingredient in a sequence of days. If `effect[i][d]` represents the effect value of ingredient `i` on day `d`, then the sequence for ingredient `i` is given for a few initial days as `a[i][1], a[i][2], ... a[i][D]`, and the pattern repeats every `D` days. To simplify potion preparation, the wizard wants to select ingredients whose combined effect value for a specified day `T` achieves a certain target value. The combined effect value for a given set of ingredients is the sum of their individual effect values on the day `T`. Your task is to help the wizard determine if the combined effect value of any subset of ingredients equals the target value, and if so, return `YES`. Otherwise, return `NO`. Input The input is formatted as follows: ``` N D T target a[1][1] a[1][2] ... a[1][D] a[2][1] a[2][2] ... a[2][D] ... a[N][1] a[N][2] ... a[N][D] ``` * `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 20) is the number of ingredients. * `D` (1 ≤ D ≤ 10) is the number of days in the repeating pattern. * `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) is the specified day. * `target` (-1000 ≤ target ≤ 1000) is the target combined effect value. The next N lines contain D integers each, where `a[i][j]` (-50 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 50) represents the effect value of ingredient `i` on the `j-th` day of the pattern.

She is currently on an adventure and has asked her friend, Sage Elara, to help her with the game. The game involves two types of operations on a string consisting only of lowercase English letters. Initially, there is an empty string `s`. The game specifies `q` tasks of two types. The first type asks Elara to add a character to the end of the string `s`. The second type asks Elara to find the length of the longest substring of `s` that contains exactly `k` distinct characters. Since you are an expert coder, Elara wants you to help her automate and accurately perform the tasks to make Princess Talia proud. Input The first line contains one integer `q` (2 ≤ q ≤ 100000) — the number of tasks the game wants you to perform. `q` lines follow, each line begins with an integer `t_i` — the type of the task: * If `t_i = 1`, a character `c_i` (\'a\' ≤ `c_i` ≤ \'z\') follows — you have to add `c_i` to the end of the string `s`. * If `t_i = 2`, an integer `k_i` (1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 26) follows — you must find the length of the longest substring that contains exactly `k_i` distinct characters, or report `-1` if no such substring exists. It is guaranteed that there is always at least one task of type 2, and the first task is always of type 1. Output For each task of type 2, output on one line the length of the longest substring that contains exactly `k_i` distinct characters, or `-1` if no such substring exists. Examples Input ``` 7 1 a 1 b 1 a 2 1 2 2 1 c 2 2 ``` Output ``` 2 3 3 ``` Input ``` 5 1 x 2 1 1 y 2 2 2 3 ``` Output ``` 1 2 -1 ``` Note In the first example, there are 7 tasks: * The first task requires you to add \'a\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"a\\". * The second task requires you to add \'b\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"ab\\". * The third task requires you to add \'a\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"aba\\". * The fourth task asks you a question with `k = 1`. The longest substring of \\"aba\\" with exactly 1 distinct character is \\"a\\" or \\"b\\", which has a length of 1. * The fifth task asks you a question with `k = 2`. The longest substring of \\"aba\\" with exactly 2 distinct characters is \\"aba\\", which has a length of 3. * The sixth task requires you to add \'c\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"abac\\". * The seventh task asks you a question with `k = 2`. The longest substring of \\"abac\\" with exactly 2 distinct characters is either \\"ab\\" or \\"ba\\", which has a length of 2 or 3. In the second example, there are 5 tasks: * The first task requires you to add \'x\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"x\\". * The second task asks you a question with `k = 1`. The longest substring of \\"x\\" with exactly 1 distinct character is \\"x\\", which has a length of 1. * The third task requires you to add \'y\' to `s`. The string `s` is now \\"xy\\". * The fourth task asks you a question with `k = 2`. The longest substring of \\"xy\\" with exactly 2 distinct characters is \\"xy\\", which also has a length of 2. * The fifth task asks you a question with `k = 3`.

The security of messages relies on encoding and decoding operations using a shared secret key between the sender and the receiver. Each message is encoded by first converting it to its ASCII values, then applying a series of bitwise operations using a key, and finally converting the transformed values back to characters. The key can vary in length, and the bitwise operations must be applied in a repeated fashion over the entire message. Here are the specific encoding steps: 1. Convert each character in the message to its ASCII value. 2. Convert each character in the key to its ASCII value. 3. For each character in the message: - XOR the ASCII value of the message character with the corresponding key character\'s ASCII value. The key is repeated if it is shorter than the message. 4. Convert the resulting values back to characters to get the encoded message. To decode a message, the same algorithm will be applied to the encoded message using the same key. You need to implement two functions: - `encode(message: str, key: str) -> str`: This function takes a message and a key as input and returns the encoded message. - `decode(encoded_message: str, key: str) -> str`: This function takes an encoded message and a key as input and returns the original message by decoding it.

One of the puzzles involves helping a player reach from a starting room to a designated goal room within a specific time frame by navigating through these corridors considering their switching pattern. Given that the player enters the maze at the start of an hour, you need to determine if it is possible to reach the goal within the given time. Problem You are given a maze consisting of N rooms and M bidirectional corridors. Each corridor switches between \'open\' and \'blocked\' states every hour. At the start of the first hour, all corridors are \'open\'. You are also given a start room and a goal room along with the maximum number of hours allowed to reach the goal. Write a program to determine whether it\'s possible to reach the goal within the given time considering the state of the corridors. Input The input is given in the following format: N M u_1 v_1 ... u_M v_M S G T The first line contains the number of rooms N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) and the number of corridors M (0 ≤ M ≤ 50,000). The next M lines each contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ N, u_i ≠ v_i) indicating a corridor between room u_i and room v_i. The last line contains three integers: S (the starting room), G (the goal room), and T (the maximum number of hours allowed). Output Output \\"YES\\" if it is possible to reach the goal within T hours, otherwise output \\"NO\\".

In this case, the subarrays [2, 4], [4, 5], [5, 3] are beautiful subarrays because: * 2 + 4 = 6 (not prime) * 4 + 5 = 9 (not prime) * 5 + 3 = 8 (not prime) * [2, 4, 5] contains pair (4, 5) whose sum is 9 (not prime) * [4, 5, 3] contains pairs (4, 5) whose sum is 9 (not prime) and (5, 3) whose sum is 8 (not prime) * [2, 4, 5, 3] contains pairs (4, 5) whose sum is 9 (not prime) and (5, 3) whose sum is 8 (not prime) Thus, in this example, there are no beautiful subarrays.

Each server hosts various microservices, and these microservices communicate with each other over a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the graph represents a microservice, and each directed edge represents a dependency between two microservices, indicating which service must be started before another. In recent updates, your team has released a new microservice architecture, but you\'re now facing deployment challenges. To ensure a flawless deployment, you need to determine the minimum time required to start up all the microservices, considering the dependencies. Each microservice takes a specific amount of time to start. Given the start times and the dependencies between microservices, calculate the minimum total time needed to start up all the microservices. You must respect the dependencies, ensuring each microservice starts only after all its dependent microservices have started. **Input Format:** - The first line contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) representing the number of microservices. - The second line contains N integers where the i-th integer represents the start time of the i-th microservice (1 ≤ start_time ≤ 10^6). - The third line contains an integer `M` (0 ≤ M ≤ 200,000) representing the number of dependencies. - Each of the next M lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N), indicating a directed edge from microservice `u` to microservice `v` (u must start before v). **Output Format:** - Print a single integer representing the minimum total time needed to start up all the microservices. **Examples:** **Example 1:** ``` Input 5 2 3 4 1 5 4 1 2 1 3 3 4 2 5 Output 10 ``` **Example 2:** ``` Input 4 2 2 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 4 Output 6 ``` **Example 3:** ``` Input 3 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 Output 6 ``` **Explanation:** In Example 1, the total minimum time to start all microservices is calculated as follows: - Start microservice 1 at time 0 and completes at time 2. - Then, start microservice 2 at time 2 and microservice 3 at time 2. - Microservice 2 completes at time 5 (2 + 3). - Microservice 3 completes at time 6 (2 + 4). - Afterwards, microservice 4 can only start after microservice 3 is completed (time 6) and it completes at time 7 (6 + 1). - Finally, microservice 5 can only start after microservice 2 is completed (time 5) and completes at time 10 (5 + 5).

Each cell in the chessboard either contains a friendly knight or is empty. Knights can jump to certain positions on the chessboard following specific rules - they can move in an L-shape: two cells in one direction and one cell perpendicular, or one cell in one direction and two cells perpendicular. Given the current positions of multiple knights on an empty chessboard, you need to determine if it is possible for all knights to simultaneously make one valid move without landing on any other knight’s starting or ending positions.

However, the shop owner wants to optimize the repair process to minimize the total repair time for all customers. They want you to write a program that schedules the bikes for repair in an optimal way. The shop can repair only one bike at a time. Each bike has a repair time associated with it, and the shop operates on a first-come, first-served basis. The goal is to schedule the bikes in such a way that the average waiting time for the customers is minimized. The waiting time for a customer is defined as the total time the customer has to wait for their bike to be fully repaired after dropping it off at the shop. For example, if a customer arrives at time 0 and their bike takes 3 units of time to repair, and the next customer arrives at time 1 and their bike takes 2 units of time to repair, the optimal schedule would repair the first customer\'s bike first (with a waiting time of 0 for them), and then repair the second customer\'s bike (with a waiting time of 3 units of time for them). Input The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset begins with an integer N on a new line, representing the number of customers. You can assume 1 <= N <= 100. The next line contains N positive integers, representing the time each bike takes to get repaired. You can assume that each repair time is between 1 and 1000.

You must handle the following constraints and edge cases: - Division by zero should output \\"Error: Division by zero\\". - The expression will not contain parentheses. - The result should be a floating point number rounded to two decimal places if it’s not an integer. # Input A single string S that represents a mathematical expression, where 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100. # Output The result of the evaluated expression or an error message if such occurs. # Examples Example 1 Input: ``` 3 + 5 / 2 ``` Output: ``` 5.50 ``` Example 2 Input: ``` 2 * 3 - 4 / 0 ``` Output: ``` Error: Division by zero ``` Example 3 Input: ``` -2 * -3 + 4 * 2 ``` Output: ``` 14.00 ``` Example 4 Input: ``` 7 / 2 ``` Output: ``` 3.50 ``` Note: When rounding the floating-point number, if a number has more than two decimal places, it will be rounded to two decimal places (e.g., 3.123456 becomes 3.12).","solution":"def evaluate_expression(expression): Evaluates a basic mathematical expression which supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. try: expression = expression.replace(\\" \\", \\"\\") result = eval(expression) if isinstance(result, float): return round(result, 2) return result except ZeroDivisionError: return \\"Error: Division by zero\\" except Exception as e: return f\\"Error: {str(e)}\\""}]'),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const s=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return s?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(s)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(s)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},C=["disabled"],F={key:0},R={key:1};function z(s,e,u,p,a,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>a.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,a.searchQuery]]),a.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>a.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(n(!0),i(w,null,_(r.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(m,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+l(a.searchQuery)+'".
