Each test case starts with two integers H and W (1 <= H, W <= 100), representing the height and width of the plot, followed by H lines each containing W characters. Each character is either a ‘.’ (empty space) or an ‘S’ (position of a scarecrow). The input ends with a single line containing ‘0 0’, and this should not be processed. Output For each test case, output the minimum number of scarecrows needed to guard the whole plot, or ‘impossible’ if it is not possible to guard the entire plot with the scarecrows that are given. Example Input: 3 3 .S. S.S .S. 4 4 S... .... ..S. .... 0 0 Output: 1 2 Explanation: In the first case, one scarecrow is already placed in the middle, which guards the entire row and column.

You need to perform the following operation any number of times to reduce the matrix: you can choose any submatrix (contiguous block of the original matrix) and replace all of its elements by the maximum element in that submatrix. The goal is to minimize the sum of all elements in the matrix. Given the matrix, determine the minimum possible sum of the elements of the matrix after performing the described operations any number of times. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), the size of the matrix. Each of the next n lines contains n space-separated integers representing the matrix elements. Each element is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). Output Output a single integer, the minimum possible sum of the elements of the matrix after the operations. Example Input 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Output 9 Input 2 100 200 300 400 Output 400 Note In the first example, you can replace any submatrix with its maximum element repeatedly until the entire matrix becomes a matrix where all elements are 9. Therefore, the result is 9 * 3 * 3 = 81 (However, to get the final minimal sum \'9\', consider the sum after each step in the submatrix replacement). In the second example, the entire matrix can be reduced to the largest element 400. Hence, the minimal sum is 400.","solution":"def minimal_matrix_sum(matrix): Given an n x n matrix, computes the minimal possible sum of the elements of the matrix after reducing it according to the rule: replace any submatrix with its maximum element.

You are given an array a where a[i][j] represents the j-th score of the i-th participant. You have to answer the following queries: 1. Given a participant index i, find the maximum score among all solutions submitted by that participant. 2. Given a participant index i, calculate the average score for that participant. The average score is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. 3. Given three integers i, j, and x, update the score of the j-th solution for the i-th participant to x. Input The first line of the input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10000) — the number of participants and the number of queries, respectively. The next n lines each contain several integers which represent the scores of the respective participant. Each line may have varying lengths but contains at least one integer, representing the score of one submitted solution (1 ≤ score ≤ 100). The length of each line does not exceed 100. Each of the next q lines describes a single query: The first type of query is described by two integers t = 1 and i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) — asking for the maximum score of the i-th participant. The second type of query is described by two integers t = 2 and i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) — asking for the average score of the i-th participant. The third type of query is described by four integers t = 3, i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ len(ai) and 1 ≤ x ≤ 100. This query updates the score of the j-th solution of the i-th participant to x. Output For each query of the first type, output the maximum score of the i-th participant. For each query of the second type, output the average score of the i-th participant (rounded to two decimal places). Example Input 3 5 90 85 88 75 92 68 80 78 70 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 95 1 1 2 1 Output 92 87.67 95 91.00 Note In the second type of query, the average score is calculated by taking the sum of all scores and dividing it by the number of scores.

In order to facilitate collaboration between departments and make the best use of resources, the Smart Beaver wants to compile a comprehensive schedule of all research activities. Each department has a set of research activity sequences that must be followed in strict order since each activity within a department depends on the completion of the previous one. However, activities from different departments are independent and can be scheduled at any time. You need to devise a strategy to compile a schedule that maximizes the utilization of available resources while minimizing idle times. Each activity from different departments has a fixed duration, depicted by di,j, where i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is the department number, and j (1 ≤ j ≤ li) is the sequence number of the activity. Write an algorithm that orders these activities so that the maximum overall idle time between activities is minimized. Idleness is defined as the time when no activity is running.

Each participant has a unique ID and a recorded finish time for the marathon. Jennifer needs to determine the top `k` fastest finishers from the list. Your task is to write a program to identify the top `k` participants based on their finish times. If two participants have the same finish time, the participant with the smaller ID should be considered faster. Input The first line of the input contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100000): - `n`: the number of participants. - `k`: the number of top finishers to determine.

Each intersection of an avenue and a street is a distinct point on the grid. The avenues are numbered from 1 to n from the top to the bottom, and the streets are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The mayor of Arland has decided to build several public parks such that each park is situated at the intersection of an avenue and a street. However, due to budget constraints, the city can only afford to build exactly k parks. Each park must be positioned at a unique intersection. To promote accessibility, the mayor wants the average Manhattan distance from all city intersections to the nearest park to be as small as possible. The Manhattan distance between two points (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) is defined as |i1 - i2| + |j1 - j2|, where |x| denotes the absolute value of x. Your task is to help the mayor determine the optimal locations for the k parks that minimize the average Manhattan distance from all intersections to the nearest park. Input: The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200; 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 1000)), where n and m denote the number of avenues and streets, respectively, and k is the number of parks to be built.

Replace them with the third character that is different from both (i.e., replace \'a\' and \'b\' with \'c\', \'a\' and \'c\' with \'b\', and \'b\' and \'c\' with \'a\'). Sarah wants to know the length of the shortest string she can achieve by repeatedly performing the aforementioned operations. **Input** - The first line contains n, the length of the string, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. - The second line contains a string of length n consisting of the characters \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\'. **Output** - Output the length of the shortest string that can be achieved. **Example** ``` Input: 7 abacbac Output: 1 Explanation: One of the possible ways to achieve the shortest string: abacbac -> cbac -> bac -> ac -> b The shortest possible length of the string is 1. ``` ``` Input: 4 aabb Output: 2 Explanation: One of the possible ways to achieve the shortest string: aabb -> b -> a The shortest possible length of the string is 2, because: 1. Replace \'a\' and \'b\' to get \'c\', \'c\', \'b\' 2. Now \'cb\' -> \'a\', \'a\' 3. Now it is not possible to reduce the length further since only two characters remain. ```","solution":"def string_reduction(n, s): Returns the length of the shortest string that can be achieved by repeatedly performing the specified reduction operations on the input string `s` of length `n`. # If the string length is 1, it\'s already reduced to the shortest length if n == 1: return 1 # If the string contains only one unique character, we cannot reduce it further if len(set(s)) == 1: return n # If the string contains exactly two distinct characters and if the length is even, # the result will be 2 (only one reduction possible in the middle) if len(set(s)) == 2 and n % 2 == 0: return 2 # If the string contains exactly two distinct characters and if the length is odd, # the result will be 1 as one further reduction is possible after reaching length 2. if len(set(s)) == 2 and n % 2 == 1: return 1 # If the string contains all three characters, it will always reduce to length 1 if len(set(s)) == 3: return 1 return n # Sample Outputs for reference assert string_reduction(7, \\"abacbac\\") == 1 assert string_reduction(4, \\"aabb\\") == 2"},{"question":"Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns another list where each element is the product of all the elements in the original list except for the element at the current position.

The system’s rules permit an artisan to post offers to either propose a barter or request a commodity. Each offer includes the artisan\'s name, the type of offer (propose or request), the commodity, and the conditions of the trade. To ensure a fair trade, two rules are applied: 1. A trade between two artisans occurs only if the conditions of both offers are reciprocally satisfied. 2. No trade is allowed between offers from the same artisan. When a new propose offer is introduced, the system matches it with the earliest request offer that satisfies its conditions. Similarly, when a new request offer is introduced, it is matched with the earliest propose offer that satisfies its conditions. The market opens every day at 8:00 and closes at 20:00. At the end of the day, all outstanding offers that haven\'t been fulfilled are cancelled. For bookkeeping, the system maintains a complete log of daily trade activities and the subsequent status of each artisan and commodity. The city planner has commissioned a software to generate a daily report which must include: - For each commodity, the total number of successful trades. - For each artisan, the commodities they have successfully traded and the number of successful trades they were involved in. Input The input sequence contains several datasets, each describing the daily trade logs of one day. Each line in a dataset provides the details of an offer in the order they were posted. The exact format is: - The first line contains an integer n (0 < n <= 1000) representing the number of offers. - Each subsequent line includes the artisan’s name, type of offer (‘PROPOSE’ or ‘REQUEST’), the commodity, and the trade condition. The names of artisans contain only capital alphabetical letters and do not exceed 10 characters. Commodity names are single capital alphabetical characters, and conditions are strings of up to 20 printable characters, excluding spaces. A line containing a zero marks the end of the input.

The warehouse can be represented as a grid of cells with obstacles. The robots must find the shortest path from the starting position to the destination position without hitting any obstacles. Given a grid of size `n x m`, where each cell is either empty (represented by `.`) or contains an obstacle (represented by `#`), you need to determine the length of the shortest path from the starting position to the destination position. The robot can move up, down, left, or right but cannot move diagonally. However, due to the design of the robots, the path must be planned such that the first step of the robot is always to the right.

Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the dimensions of the grid. The next n lines contain m characters each, where \'.\' represents an empty cell and \'#\' represents an obstacle.

Bob, a software developer, has been contracted to create a system that is scalable and supports various transactions efficiently. Bob\'s latest task involves implementing a feature for a bank which allows customers to manage their bank accounts through specific operations. These operations include transferring money between accounts and querying the current balance of specific accounts. The bank has n accounts, each with a unique account number from 1 to n and an initial balance. Bob needs to implement two types of operations for the bank: * 1 x y z: This operation denotes transferring z amount of money from account x to account y. It is guaranteed that the account x will always have at least z amount of money before the transfer. * 2 x: This operation requests the balance of account x. Given the initial balances of the accounts and a sequence of m operations, Bob needs to perform these operations and return the results for each balance query. Input The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), the number of accounts and the number of operations, respectively.

This shift wraps around, so after \'z\' comes \'a\'. To make it more challenging, Alice has decided to transform the string such that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. Can you help Alice perform this transformation to get the lexicographically smallest string? Input The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) — the length of the string. The second line contains the string S of length N consisting of only lowercase English letters. Output Output the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing the described transformation. Example Input 5 abxyz Output aaaaaaaaaa Note In the first example, Alice can choose the characters \'a\', \'b\', \'x\', \'y\', and \'z\', and shift each of them by a certain number of positions in the alphabetical order to make every character \'a\'. This results in the lexicographically smallest string, \\"aaaaa\\".","solution":"def lexicographically_smallest_string(N, S): Returns the lexicographically smallest string possible after transforming the input string S. Parameters: - N (int): the length of the string - S (str): a string of length N consisting of only lowercase English letters Returns: - str: the lexicographically smallest string possible # Since \'a\' is the smallest character, the smallest lexicographical string # will be a string of \'a\'s of length N return \'a\' * N"},{"question":"A warehouse maintains a system for tracking storage boxes.

For the third test case, applying the boost makes the step count [500, 1500, 500], which can potentially meet the goal over a two-day segment if the goal is realistically considered.","solution":"def fitness_goal_is_met(t, test_cases): results = [] for case in test_cases: n, k, d = case[\'params\'] steps = case[\'steps\'] boosts = case[\'boosts\'] # Apply boosts to steps for bi, si in boosts: steps[bi - 1] += si # Check for any consecutive segment of exactly d days found_segment = False for i in range(n - d + 1): segment_sum = sum(steps[i:i + d]) if segment_sum >= case[\'goal\']: found_segment = True break results.append(\\"YES\\" if found_segment else \\"NO\\") return results"},{"question":"You are working on a project that involves analyzing social media messages. Your task is to develop a program that will detect and correct common typographical errors in text messages. For this task, you will focus on a specific type of error: letter repetition (e.g., \\"helllo\\" should be corrected to \\"hello\\"). Given a list of words and a mapping of possible corrections, your program should correct any word in the input text that has a repetitive letter sequence if a correct word is provided in the mapping. If a word has multiple repetitive letters, correct all of them. If a word cannot be corrected based on the given mapping, it should remain unchanged. Input The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of words in the correction mapping. Each of the next n lines contains a pair of strings: the incorrect word (which may contain repetitive letters) and the correct word. The following line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — the number of words in the input text message. The next line contains m space-separated strings, which are the words in the text message. Output Output a single line containing the corrected text message, with the corrected (or original, if no correction was found) words separated by spaces. Example Input 3 helllo hello wrld world tessst test 5 hello wrld tessst tomorrow helllo Output hello world test tomorrow hello Note In the input example, \\"helllo\\" maps to \\"hello\\", \\"wrld\\" maps to \\"world\\", and \\"tessst\\" maps to \\"test\\". The words \\"hello\\" and \\"tomorrow\\" do not have corrections and remain unchanged.","solution":"def correct_typographical_errors(mapping_list, text_words): correction_mapping = {incorrect: correct for incorrect, correct in mapping_list} corrected_text = [ correction_mapping.get(word, word) for word in text_words ] return \\" \\".join(corrected_text) def parse_input(n, n_pairs, m, m_words): mapping_list = [tuple(n_pairs[i].split()) for i in range(n)] text_words = m_words.split() return mapping_list, text_words # Example Input n = 3 n_pairs = [\'helllo hello\', \'wrld world\', \'tessst test\'] m = 5 m_words = \'hello wrld tessst tomorrow helllo\' # Parse input mapping_list, text_words = parse_input(n, n_pairs, m, m_words) # Get corrected text corrected_text = correct_typographical_errors(mapping_list, text_words) print(corrected_text)"},{"question":"In an amusement park, there is a roller coaster ride that has a train of seats arranged in a single row. A group of n friends wants to sit together, but each one of them has a different preference for which row they want to sit on. Each seat is identified by an integer from 1 to m (1-indexed) representing its position in the row. The amusement park uses a booking system that processes a series of requests from the friends. Each request specifies a friend and their preferred seat. If the seat is already taken by someone else, the friend will simply choose the closest available seat to their preference. If there are multiple seats at the same distance, the friend will choose the seat with the smaller number. Your task is to simulate this booking system and determine the seat each friend gets. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000): the number of friends and the number of seats in the row. The second line contains n integers, where the i-th integer is the preferred seat of the i-th friend (1 ≤ preferred_seat_i ≤ m). Output Output n integers where the i-th integer is the seat number assigned to the i-th friend in the order of their requests. Example Input 3 5 2 4 3 Output 2 4 3 Input 4 6 6 4 6 5 Output 6 4 5 3 Explanation In the first example, all preferred seats are initially free, so friends get their desired seats. In the second example, the first friend takes seat 6, the second one takes seat 4, the third one can no longer take seat 6 and takes the nearest available seat which is 5. The fourth friend wants seat 5 but takes the next available seat which is 3.","solution":"def assign_seats(n, m, preferences): Assigns seats to friends based on their preferences and availability.
