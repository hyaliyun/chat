However, due to a recent software glitch, some prices got mixed up and might not be correct. You are given the prices of the items as an array. Your job is to determine if it is possible to reorder the array such that for a given integer k, the bitwise XOR of any k consecutive prices is equal to a predefined target value. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) – the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case begins with two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ n), where n is the number of items and k is the number of consecutive items whose XOR needs to match the target.

The warehouse stores multiple types of items, and you need to develop a program to track the inventory levels. The items can be added, removed, or their quantities adjusted based on deliveries and shipments. Each operation is provided in a specific format, and your task is to implement a system that processes these operations and returns the final inventory levels for each item. The warehouse operates with the following rules: 1. Each item is uniquely identified by a string identifier. 2. An operation can be: - \'add\': Add a new item to the inventory with a specified quantity. - \'remove\': Remove an existing item from the inventory. - \'update\': Update the quantity of an existing item. 3. If an \'add\' operation is performed on an item that already exists, its quantity should be increased by the specified amount. 4. If a \'remove\' operation is performed on an item that does not exist, it should be ignored. 5. \'Update\' operation changes the quantity of an existing item to the new specified amount, if the item does not exist, it should be ignored. Input - The input consists of multiple lines where each line represents an operation. - Each operation is in one of the following formats: - `add item_identifier quantity` - `remove item_identifier` - `update item_identifier new_quantity` - You can assume that item_identifiers are alphanumeric strings without spaces, and quantities are non-negative integers. - The input is terminated by a line containing only one character \'.\'. Output - Output each item and its corresponding quantity, sorted lexicographically by item_identifier. If an item was removed, it should not appear in the output. Example Input ``` add apples 50 add bananas 30 update apples 20 remove bananas update oranges 15 add grapes 40 . ``` Example Output ``` apples: 20 grapes: 40 ``` Note: Be sure to handle cases sensitively where operations might not find their target items or when quantities need proper adjustments based on the rules provided.","solution":"def manage_inventory(operations): inventory = {} for operation in operations: if operation == \'.\': break parts = operation.split() command = parts[0] item = parts[1] if command == \'add\': quantity = int(parts[2]) if item in inventory: inventory[item] += quantity else: inventory[item] = quantity elif command == \'remove\': if item in inventory: del inventory[item] elif command == \'update\': new_quantity = int(parts[2]) if item in inventory: inventory[item] = new_quantity sorted_inventory = sorted(inventory.items()) result = [] for item, quantity in sorted_inventory: result.append(f\\"{item}: {quantity}\\") return result"},{"question":"# Task: You need to write a function, **wave_generator**, that takes a string as an input and creates a wave pattern as shown in the examples below.

Your task is to determine if Anna can traverse the given landmarks in the exact order specified. Input The input data consists of three parts: the first part provides the city layout as a list of directed roads between intersections. The second part gives the total number of intersections in the city, and the third part lists the sequence of landmarks Anna wants to visit. 1. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of intersections (nodes). 2. The second line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000) — the number of directed roads (edges). 3. Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) — denoting a directed road from node u to node v. 4. The last line contains a sequence of integers representing the landmarks (nodes) Anna wants to visit, separated by spaces. The length of this sequence will not exceed 100. Output Output \\"possible\\" if Anna can visit all the landmarks in the order specified; otherwise, output \\"impossible.\\" Examples Input 5 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 2 4 1 3 1 3 4 5 Output possible Input 5 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 2 4 1 3 1 4 3 5 Output impossible Note In the first example, Anna can visit the landmarks by taking the direct roads: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.

The warehouse is located at the top-left corner of the grid (0,0) and the delivery point at the bottom-right corner (M-1,N-1). The drone needs to determine the length of the shortest path from the warehouse to the delivery point. If the delivery point cannot be reached, the algorithm should return -1. Input Format The first line contains two integers M and N, the dimensions of the grid. The next M lines each contain N integers (either 0 or 1) representing the grid. A 0 represents an empty cell, and a 1 represents a blocked cell. Output Format A single integer representing the length of the shortest path, or -1 if the delivery point cannot be reached. Constraints 1 <= M, N <= 100 The grid will always have both the warehouse and the delivery point as empty cells (0).

Each query will specify the starting and ending positions within the string, and you have to determine if the substring within that range forms a palindrome. -----Brute-Force:----- For each query, extract the substring from the given range and check if it reads the same forwards as backwards. -----DP:----- Use a Dynamic Programming approach to precompute whether substrings of various lengths are palindromes. This can be achieved by the following steps: 1. Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be True if the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome. 2. Initialize the array: - All substrings of length 1 are palindromes (`dp[i][i] = True`). - Check and initialize substrings of length 2 accordingly. 3.

The data structure should maintain a list of integers and be able to perform the following operations efficiently: inserting a new integer, removing an existing integer, and querying the k-th smallest integer in the list. However, to keep things interesting, Sarah decides to introduce the concept of “undo” operation, which reverts the most recent operation performed (whether it was an insertion or a removal). To help Sarah, you need to design and implement this data structure. More specifically, you are to implement a class `UndoableList` with the following methods: 1. `insert(x)`: Insert the integer `x` into the list. 2. `remove(x)`: Remove one occurrence of the integer `x` from the list. If `x` does not exist in the list, do nothing. 3. `kth_smallest(k)`: Return the k-th smallest integer in the list. The list\'s smallest element has k = 1. 4. `undo()`: Revert the most recent operation (insertion or removal). It is guaranteed that every `kth_smallest` query will have a valid `k` (i.e., k will be within the number of elements currently in the list) and the data structure will never perform undo operations exceeding the number of operations already performed. -----Input----- Each input will consist of a list of commands executed sequentially on an initially empty instance of `UndoableList`.

Each light can be turned on or off to represent a binary number. However, due to their rapid technological advancement, they\'ve started using a modified version of binary arithmetic which includes a special operation called gamma operation. The gamma operation is defined as follows: gamma: when this operation is applied to a binary number, each \'0\' bit in the number is flipped to \'1\', and each \'1\' bit is flipped to \'0\'. However, there are some constraints while performing the gamma operation: - The operation can only be applied if the resulting number does not exceed a specified upper limit L in its decimal form. - The operation can only be applied if the resulting number is not lower than a specified lower limit M in its decimal form. You are given a binary number B as an input, and you have to perform exactly N gamma operations on it or the maximum possible number of gamma operations, whichever comes first.

The state of each cell changes from one generation to the next based on the states of its eight neighbors, according to the following rules: 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. Given an initial state of the grid, you are to compute the state of the grid after `n` generations. The input consists of: - An integer `n` which represents the number of generations to simulate. - A 2D array `grid` of size `m x m` representing the initial state of the grid where `1` represents a live cell and `0` represents a dead cell.

To test his understanding, he has decided to implement a simple hash table functionality. The task is to design a hash table that supports insertion, deletion, and search operations. However, Tom wants to implement a specific variant where each string key can store an associated integer value, and if there are multiple values for a string key, it should store the sum of those values. Write a Python class named `SimpleHashTable` that implements the following methods: 1. `insert(key: str, value: int) -> None`: Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, update its value by adding the given value to the existing value. 2. `delete(key: str) -> None`: Deletes the key-value pair from the hash table if it exists. 3. `search(key: str) -> int`: Returns the value associated with the key if it exists, otherwise returns -1. -----Input----- - The input will consist of multiple lines, each representing an operation in the format: - `\\"insert key value\\"` - `\\"delete key\\"` - `\\"search key\\"` It should be able to handle an arbitrary number of these operations. -----Output----- - For `search` operations, output the value associated with the key if it exists, otherwise output -1. -----Example----- Input: insert apple 10 insert banana 5 insert apple 5 search apple delete banana search banana search grape insert grape 15 search grape Output: 15 -1 -1 15 -----Example Explanation----- - First, apple is associated with 10.

You are given a stream of scores, and you need to track the top \\"k\\" highest scores at any given time. Implement a function `update_leaderboard(k: int, scores: List[int]) -> List[int]` where: - `k` is the number of top scores to maintain on the leaderboard. - `scores` is a list of integers representing the scores submitted by players over time. The function should return a list of the top \\"k\\" highest scores in non-increasing order after processing all the incoming scores. If there are fewer than \\"k\\" scores in total, return all the scores sorted in non-increasing order. ----- Input ----- - A single integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) - A list of integers `scores` where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ score ≤ 10^9) and the list can contain up to 10^5 scores. ----- Output ----- - A list of integers representing the top `k` scores in non-increasing order. ----- Examples ----- Input: k = 3 scores = [40, 10, 30, 50, 60] Output: [60, 50, 40] Input: k = 5 scores = [56, 78, 90, 32, 45] Output: [90, 78, 56, 45, 32] Explanation: In the first example, the top 3 scores are [60, 50, 40] after processing all scores. In the second example, all scores are returned as there are less than 5 scores in total and they are sorted in non-increasing order. **Note:** The solution should be optimized to handle the updating of the leaderboard efficiently as new scores come in.

He is currently at the starting point (0 meters) and needs to reach the finish line at point l. However, there are n water stations placed along the highway where Rafael can replenish his water supply. The i-th water station is located at distance d_{i} meters from the starting point and Rafael can refill his water supply in t_{i} seconds at that station. Rafael has two options: 1. Run directly to the finish line without stopping at any water stations. 2. Stop at any of the water stations to refill his water supply, which takes additional time, but might help him run faster. Rafael runs at different constant speeds: - If he doesn\'t stop at any water station, he runs with a speed of s1 meters per second. - If he stops at the i-th water station (only one stop is allowed), he then runs the remaining distance with a speed of s2 meters per second. Write a function to calculate the minimum time Rafael needs to reach the finish line, considering both options. # Input - The first line contains two integers l and n (1 ≤ l ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the highway and the number of water stations respectively. - The second line contains two integers s1 and s2 (1 ≤ s1, s2 ≤ 100) — Rafael\'s running speeds. - The next n lines each contain two integers d_{i} and t_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} < l, 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 1000) — the distance of i-th water station from the starting point and the refill time at that station. # Output Print a single real value — the minimum time Rafael needs to reach the finish line. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}. # Examples Input 1 ``` 100 2 5 10 20 3 80 2 ``` Output 1 ``` 10.80000000000000000000 ``` Explanation 1 If Rafael runs directly to the finish line at a speed of 5 meters per second, he will take 100 / 5 = 20 seconds. If he stops at the first water station at 20 meters, he takes 20 / 5 = 4 seconds, refills for 3 seconds, and then runs the remaining 80 meters at 10 meters per second, which takes 80 / 10 = 8 seconds. The total time in this case is 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 seconds. If he stops at the second water station at 80 meters, he takes 80 / 5 = 16 seconds, refills for 2 seconds, and runs the remaining 20 meters at 10 meters per second which takes 20 / 10 = 2 seconds. The total time in this case is 16 + 2 + 2 = 20 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time is 10.8 seconds. Input 2 ``` 50 0 6 9 ``` Output 2 ``` 8.33333333333333333333 ``` Explanation 2 Since there are no water stations, Rafael will run directly to the finish line at a speed of 6 meters per second, taking 50 / 6 = 8.333333333333333 seconds. # Note - It is possible that Rafael might choose not to stop at any water station if his overall time increases by stopping. - Ensure that the calculation checks all possible station stops and compares against the direct run time to find the minimum.","solution":"def minimum_time_to_meet(l, n, s1, s2, stations): # Time to reach finish line without stopping min_time = l / s1 for d_i, t_i in stations: time_with_stop = (d_i / s1) + t_i + ((l - d_i) / s2) if time_with_stop < min_time: min_time = time_with_stop return min_time"},{"question":"Chef has two arrays A and B, both of length N.

Each student has a unique ID and the university needs a system to keep track of certain academic aspects. Your task is to implement the following functionalities: 1. Register a new student: When a new student arrives, they should be assigned a unique ID which is an integer in an incrementing sequence starting from 1. 2. Assign a grade: Assign a grade to a student for a specific course. Each grade is a floating-point number between 0 and 100. A student can receive multiple grades for the same course throughout their academic life. 3. Calculate GPA: The Grade Point Average (GPA) for a student is the average of the highest grade they have received in each course. Implement a class `University` with the following methods: - `register_student() -> int`: Registers a new student and returns their unique ID. - `assign_grade(student_id: int, course_id: int, grade: float) -> None`: Assigns a grade to a student for a specific course. If the student has previously received grades for this course, this grade is added to the list of grades. - `calculate_gpa(student_id: int) -> float`: Calculates and returns the GPA of a student. The GPA is the average of the highest grade in each course. **Input/Output:** Your code should not take input/output as part of the methods. All inputs are function arguments and outputs should be returned from the functions.
