The goal is to keep track of the books borrowed and returned by library members to ensure that each member follows their borrowing limits. Library System The library system maintains a records list of books and members. Each book has a unique `book_id`, and each member is identified by a unique `member_id`. Members can borrow multiple books, but they have a limit on how many books they can have borrowed at any time. # Classes to Implement 1. `Book`: * Attributes: `book_id` (int), `title` (str), `author` (str) * Methods: `__init__(self, book_id: int, title: str, author: str)` 2. `Member`: * Attributes: `member_id` (int), `name` (str), `borrowed_books` (list of `Book` objects) * Methods: * `__init__(self, member_id: int, name: str, limit: int)`: Initialize the member with an ID, name, borrow limit, and an empty list of borrowed books. * `borrow_book(self, book: Book) -> str`: Adds a book to `borrowed_books` list if the member hasn’t reached their limit. Returns a message indicating success or failure. * `return_book(self, book: Book) -> str`: Removes a book from the `borrowed_books` list if the book is currently borrowed by the member. Returns a message indicating success or failure. 3. `Library`: * Attributes: `books` (list of `Book` objects), `members` (list of `Member` objects) * Methods: * `__init__(self)`: Initialize the library with empty lists of books and members. * `add_book(self, book: Book)`: Adds a book to `books` list. * `register_member(self, member: Member)`: Register a member by adding to `members` list. * `find_member_by_id(self, member_id: int) -> Member`: Finds and returns a member object by their ID. * `find_book_by_id(self, book_id: int) -> Book`: Finds and returns a book object by its ID.

Prerequisites This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list. If you do not know what that is, you may want to read up on [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list). Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are **singly linked lists**, where the value of a specific node is stored in its `data`/`data`/`Data` property, the reference to the next node is stored in its `next`/`next`/`Next`/`next_node` property and the terminator for a list is `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()`.

In that case, the reversed linked list would simply be `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` (again, depending on the language). For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any `Node` in this Kata may only contain **non-negative integer** values.

You will be given a string `s` and a set of words `word_dict`. You have to determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words and reconstruct the sequence. ---Greedy Algorithm:--- You will check each possible prefix of the string and verify if it is a word in dictionary. If a prefix is a word, recursively check the suffix. ---Dynamic Programming:--- You will construct a boolean array dp[] where dp[i] indicates if the string s[0:i] can be segmented into dictionary words. Also, maintain a backtracking table to reconstruct the solution. ---Pseudo Code for DP:--- ```cpp bool wordBreak(s, word_dict): n = length of s dp = array of false (size n + 1) dp[0] = true // base case: empty string for i = 1 to n inclusive: for j = 0 to i - 1 inclusive: if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_dict: dp[i] = true break return dp[n] ``` To reconstruct the sequence, maintain a backtracking table to store the positions that led to a successful segmentation. ---Input:--- The first line of input is the number of test cases `t`.

Your task is to write a program that takes Alice\'s original string S and outputs the transformed string T following the aforementioned rules. ----Input:---- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. - The description of T test cases follows. - Each test case consists of a single line containing the string S. -----Output:----- For each test case, output the transformed string T. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5 -----Sample Input:----- 2 aabbccc zzzxy -----Sample Output:----- a2b2c3 z3x1y1 -----Explanation:----- For the first test case: - \'a\' appears 2 consecutive times, so it is replaced with \'a2\' - \'b\' appears 2 consecutive times, so it is replaced with \'b2\' - \'c\' appears 3 consecutive times, so it is replaced with \'c3\' Hence, the output is \'a2b2c3\'. For the second test case: - \'z\' appears 3 consecutive times, so it is replaced with \'z3\' - \'x\' appears once, so it is replaced with \'x1\' - \'y\' appears once, so it is replaced with \'y1\' Hence, the output is \'z3x1y1\'.","solution":"def transform_string(s): Transforms the string s according to the specified rules. if not s: return \\"\\" result = [] count = 1 for i in range(1, len(s)): if s[i] == s[i-1]: count += 1 else: result.append(f\\"{s[i-1]}{count}\\") count = 1 result.append(f\\"{s[-1]}{count}\\") return \\"\\".join(result) def process_test_cases(test_cases): results = [] for s in test_cases: results.append(transform_string(s)) return results"},{"question":"You are a geneticist working on decoding DNA sequences.

In this task, you are going to define a class `VList` which stands for Variable List. `VList` should wrap a standard list but with some special behaviors: 1. **Instantiation**: When a `VList` is created, it should accept any number of integer arguments, which will be the initial list elements. ```python v = VList(1, 2, 3) print(v) # Output: [1, 2, 3] ``` 2. **List-Like Operations**: - Implement `__len__` that returns the number of items in the list. - Implement `__getitem__` to support indexing and slicing. - Implement `__setitem__` to allow assigning to existing indices. - Implement `__delitem__` to allow deleting an item at a specific index. - Implement `__iter__` to allow iteration through the list. 3. **Variable Argument Addition**: - Define a method `add` that can accept any number of integer/float arguments and add these values to each corresponding element of the wrapped list. If arguments provided are fewer than the list length, process only the corresponding length. If more arguments are given, ignore the extra ones. ```python v = VList(1, 2, 3) v.add(3, 4, 5) print(v) # Output: [4, 6, 8] v.add(1) print(v) # Output: [5, 6, 8] ``` 4. **String Representation**: - Override `__str__` and `__repr__` to print the list in the following format: `VList([1, 2, 3])`.

Each type of fruit is identified by a unique number from `1` to `n`, and each fruit has a certain sweetness level associated with it. The sweetness level is given in a list `sweetness` of length `n`, where `sweetness[i]` is the sweetness level of the fruit type `i+1`. Mary wants to select some of these fruits to maximize the total sweetness of the basket. However, there are two constraints: 1. She can select at most `k` different types of fruits. 2. The total number of fruits she can select should not exceed `m`. Write a function `maximize_sweetness(sweetness, k, m)` that takes the following parameters: - `sweetness`: a list of integers [s1, s2, ..., sn] where si is the sweetness level of the fruit type `i+1`. - `k`: an integer representing the maximum number of different types of fruits she can select. - `m`: an integer representing the maximum total number of fruits she can select. The function should return the maximum possible total sweetness that Mary can achieve under the given constraints. Example: ```python def maximize_sweetness(sweetness, k, m): # Your code here # Test cases print(maximize_sweetness([3, 2, 5, 1], 2, 5)) # Should return 10 print(maximize_sweetness([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 7)) # Should return 15 print(maximize_sweetness([10, 20, 30], 1, 2)) # Should return 60 ``` Explanation: 1.

People on this planet love palindromic numbers, but in binary format. Being a programmer, you have been given a task to help the inhabitants of Codearth. Given an integer N, you need to determine the minimum number of bit flips (changing a 0 to 1 or a 1 to 0) required to make the binary representation of N a palindrome. Consider the binary representation without leading zeros. -----Input :----- - The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. - Then each of the next T lines contains a single integer N. -----Output :----- For each test case, print the minimum number of bit flips required to make the binary representation of N a palindrome in its minimal form. -----Constraints :----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6 -----Sample Input :----- 2 7 10 -----Sample Output :----- 0 2 -----Explanation :----- For the first testcase: - Binary representation of 7 is \\"111\\", which is already a palindrome. Hence, 0 flips are needed. For the second testcase: - Binary representation of 10 is \\"1010\\". To make it a palindrome, you can flip the first and last bit to get \\"0110\\" or \\"1001\\", but flipping the second and third bits to get \\"1111\\" requires 2 flips.","solution":"def min_flips_to_palindrome(n): bin_n = bin(n)[2:] # Get binary representation without the \'0b\' prefix length = len(bin_n) flips = 0 for i in range(length // 2): if bin_n[i] != bin_n[length - i - 1]: flips += 1 return flips def solve_palindromic_bit_flips(test_cases): results = [] for n in test_cases: results.append(min_flips_to_palindrome(n)) return results"},{"question":"A logistics company has a set of delivery trucks and a list of delivery locations they need to cover within a day.

Create a function: ``` def trucks_can_deliver(truck_capacity, delivery_locations): # returns True if all locations can be visited, else False ``` The function takes in: 1. `truck_capacity`: an integer representing the maximum number of locations a truck can visit before refueling. 2. `delivery_locations`: an integer representing the total number of locations that need to be visited. The function should return `True` if it is possible to visit all the delivery locations with one truck without refueling, or `False` if it\'s not possible. # Example ```python print(trucks_can_deliver(10, 8)) # Output: True (Since the truck can visit up to 10 locations, and there are only 8 locations to visit.) print(trucks_can_deliver(5, 20)) # Output: False (Since the truck can visit only up to 5 locations in one go, and there are 20 locations to visit.) ``` # Constraints - 1 ≤ `truck_capacity` ≤ 10^4 - 1 ≤ `delivery_locations` ≤ 10^4","solution":"def trucks_can_deliver(truck_capacity, delivery_locations): Determines if it is possible to visit all delivery locations with one truck without refueling. :param truck_capacity: int, maximum number of locations a truck can visit before refueling. :param delivery_locations: int, total number of locations that need to be visited. :return: bool, True if possible to visit all locations with one truck without refueling, else False. return truck_capacity >= delivery_locations"},{"question":"Write a function that takes an input list of non-negative integers and returns a new list where each element is the product of all the numbers in the original list except the number at the current index.
