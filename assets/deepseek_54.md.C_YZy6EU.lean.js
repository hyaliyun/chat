To optimize storage and speed up transmission, you decide to implement a function that compresses text using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

For binary classification, the probabilities for a data point x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_d) to belong to class y in {0, 1} can be computed as: [ P(y mid x) = frac{ P(x mid y) cdot P(y) }{ P(x) } ] But since P(x) is the same for all classes, we can compare the numerator only: [ P(y mid x) propto P(y) cdot prod_{i=1}^{d} P(x_i mid y) ] Where: - ( P(y) ) is the prior probability of class y. - ( P(x_i mid y) ) is the likelihood of feature ( x_i ) given class y.

Select the middle element of the sorted array as the root of the BST. 2. Recursively build the left subtree using the left half of the array. 3. Recursively build the right subtree using the right half of the array. This will ensure the BST is height-balanced.

A circular buffer wraps around when filled, meaning once it reaches its capacity and an additional element is added, it overwrites the oldest element in the buffer. Your implementation should provide methods to add elements to the buffer, retrieve elements, and check the current state of the buffer. **Objectives:** 1. Implement a class `CircularBuffer` with the following methods: - `write(value: int) -> None`: Adds an element to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it should overwrite the oldest element. - `read() -> int`: Retrieves and removes the oldest element from the buffer. If the buffer is empty, it should raise an `IndexError` with a custom message \\"Buffer is empty\\". - `is_full() -> bool`: Returns `True` if the buffer is full, otherwise `False`. - `is_empty() -> bool`: Returns `True` if the buffer is empty, otherwise `False`. 2.

The function should return an integer representing the maximum buffer time, measured in terms of the number of packets that can be accommodated consecutively without exceeding the total buffer size. # Input - `packet_sizes`: List of integers `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` (1 ≤ packet_sizes[i] ≤ 1000) where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` indicates the size of each incoming data packet. - `total_buffer_size`: an integer (1 ≤ total_buffer_size ≤ 10,000) representing the total buffer capacity. # Output - Returns a single integer representing the maximum number of consecutive packets that can be buffered without exceeding the total buffer size. # Constraints Ensure your function handles various edge cases, including: - Packets with the same size. - Total buffer size smaller than any single packet size. - Large number of packets and variations in packet sizes. # Example ```python packet_sizes = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500] total_buffer_size = 800 max_buffer_time(packet_sizes, total_buffer_size) # Expected Output: 3 ``` # Notes - The function should aim for an efficient solution, preferably in O(n) or O(n log n) time complexity. - Test your implementation with different buffer sizes and packet arrangements to ensure robustness. # Explanation In the given example, the function calculates that the maximum number of packets which fit consecutively into the buffer without exceeding the buffer size of 800 is 3 (i.e., the packets [100, 200, 300]). The 4th packet would exceed the buffer size, thus the function returns 3.","solution":"def max_buffer_time(packet_sizes, total_buffer_size): Returns the maximum number of consecutive packets that can be buffered without exceeding the total buffer size. :param packet_sizes: List of integers representing the sizes of incoming data packets. :param total_buffer_size: Integer representing the total buffer size capacity. :return: Integer representing the maximum number of consecutive packets that can be buffered. current_sum = 0 max_packets = 0 for packet in packet_sizes: if current_sum + packet <= total_buffer_size: current_sum += packet max_packets += 1 else: break return max_packets"},{"question":"# Coding Assessment Question Context You are developing a feature for a search engine that filters stop words out of search queries.

A binary tree is considered a valid BST if it satisfies the following constraints: 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\'s key. 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\'s key. 3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. **Function Signature**: ```python class TreeNode: def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None): self.val = val self.left = left self.right = right def is_valid_bst(root: TreeNode) -> bool: Determine if the binary tree rooted at \'root\' is a valid binary search tree (BST). Parameters: root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree to check. Returns: bool: True if the tree is a valid BST, False otherwise.

The method should return True if the node is found, otherwise False. 3. **Delete a Node**: - Implement the delete method to remove a node with a given key from the BST, ensuring the tree properties are maintained. # Class Specification You need to complete the `BinarySearchTree` class with the following methods: - `insert(self, key)`: Inserts a node with the specified key into the BST. - `search(self, key)`: Searches for a node with the specified key in the BST and returns True if found, False otherwise. - `delete(self, key)`: Deletes a node with the specified key from the BST.

The rate limiter should enforce limits on the number of operations performed, ensuring that no more than `max_calls` operations can occur within a time window defined by `time_window_seconds`. Class Definition Your task is to implement the `RateLimiter` class with the following methods: - `__init__(self, max_calls: int, time_window_seconds: int)`: Initializes the rate limiter with a maximum number of allowed calls (`max_calls`) within a time window (`time_window_seconds`). - `allow_request(self) -> bool`: Returns `True` if a new request can be allowed under the rate limit, otherwise returns `False`. - `__str__(self) -> str`: Returns a string representation indicating the number of remaining allowed calls and the time left in the current window. Requirements: 1. Ensure the class enforces the rate limit strictly by keeping track of the timestamp of each allowed request. 2. The `allow_request` method should respect the time window and the maximum number of calls allowed within that window. 3. The class should efficiently manage and check the timing of requests. Constraints: - Consider the system clock functions for getting current time accurately. - The implementation should handle edge cases such as requests exactly on the boundary of the time window. - The rate limiter should be able to handle calls spaced arbitrarily close together.

The system analyzes user browsing and purchase history to suggest relevant products. However, the current system tends to recommend highly popular items frequently, creating a lack of diverse recommendations for users with unique preferences. # Task Your task is to improve the recommendation algorithm by incorporating diversity into the recommendation list. This involves modifying an existing collaborative filtering algorithm to ensure that the recommended items are not only relevant but also diverse, thereby improving user satisfaction. **Function to Implement**: You need to implement a new method `diversify_recommendations` within the `RecommendationSystem` class. This method should adjust the recommendation scores to de-emphasize items that are already highly popular and promote items that increase the diversity of the recommendations. **Input**: - `recommendations`: A dictionary where keys are item IDs and values are their recommendation scores. - `user_id`: The ID of the user for whom the recommendations are being made. - `top_n`: The number of top recommendations to return. The `RecommendationSystem` class has access to the following attributes: - `user_item_matrix`: A matrix representing user interactions (ratings) with items. - `item_popularity`: A dictionary where keys are item IDs and values are their popularity scores. **Output**: - A list of `top_n` item IDs with adjusted recommendation scores that reflect both relevance and diversity. **Constraints**: - Ensure a balance between relevance and diversity in the recommendations. - Avoid recommending items that are not relevant to the user. # Steps to Complete 1. Implement the `diversify_recommendations` method in the `RecommendationSystem` class. 2. Utilize the `user_item_matrix` to assess item relevance. 3.

Requirements 1. **Class Signature**: ```python class QueueSystem: def __init__(self): # Initialize the queue system pass def enqueue(self, element): # Add an element to the end of the queue pass def dequeue(self): # Remove an element from the front of the queue and return it pass def current_state(self): # Return a list of elements currently in the queue pass ``` 2. **Methods**: - `enqueue(element)`: Takes an element and adds it to the end of the queue. - `dequeue()`: Removes the frontmost element from the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, raise an `IndexError` with the message \\"Queue is empty\\". - `current_state()`: Returns a list of all elements currently in the queue in the order they were added. 3. **Constraints**: - Elements can be of any data type. Examples ```python >>> q = QueueSystem() >>> q.enqueue(10) >>> q.enqueue(20) >>> q.enqueue(30) >>> q.current_state() [10, 20, 30] >>> q.dequeue() 10 >>> q.current_state() [20, 30] >>> q.dequeue() 20 >>> q.dequeue() 30 >>> q.dequeue() Traceback (most recent call last): ...
