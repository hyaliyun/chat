Maria wants to maximize the number of k x k square sections that are fully watered without any overlap between the sections. Your task is to determine the maximum number of k x k square sections that can be watered by placing sprinklers optimally in Maria\'s garden. Additionally, you need to specify the value of k that maximizes the number of non-overlapping k x k square sections. Input The only line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the dimensions of Maria\'s garden.

If instead the garden was larger, for example 6 x 6, four 3 x 3 sprinklers would be the optimal solution because they fully utilize the space without overlapping. Using these sprinklers, Maria can ensure that her garden is effectively watered, maximizing the coverage and ensuring her unique plants thrive.","solution":"def max_sprinklers(n, m): Returns the size of the square section k and the maximum number of non-overlapping k x k sections that can be watered. k = min(n, m) max_sections = (n // k) * (m // k) return k, max_sections"},{"question":"Given a directed graph and two vertices, find the shortest path between the two vertices.

She has a list of integers and she needs to sort them using a specific sorting algorithm called \\"Bouncing Search Sort\\". This sorting algorithm works as follows: 1. Start from the first element of the list. 2. Compare it with the next element. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them. 3. Move to the next element and repeat the comparison and swap process until you reach the end of the list. 4. Once you reach the end of the list, bounce back to the beginning of the list and repeat steps 2-3.

If the input is plain text, convert it to Morse code. 4. If the input is Morse code, convert it to plain text. 5. Assume the input will consist only of letters and spaces (for plain text) and the described Morse code symbols (for Morse code). # Morse Code Reference: Note: Use \'/\' to represent a space between words in Morse code. ``` A: .- N: -. 0: ----- B: -...

If the simplified fraction is an improper fraction (i.e., N >= D), convert it into a mixed number in the form \\"A B/C\\" where A is the integer part of the fraction, and B/C is the simplified remainder (where B < C). If the remainder is zero, only output the integer A. 3. If the fraction is proper (i.e., N < D), output the fraction in its simplest form N/D. # Input The input consists of one dataset of fractions. The input data is given in the following format: ``` Q fraction1 fraction2 ... fractionQ ``` The first line contains the integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000), denoting the number of fractions.

Each transaction in the list is represented by a tuple (type, amount) where `type` indicates whether it\'s a debit (D) or credit (C) transaction and `amount` specifies the transaction amount. The function should return the final balance after processing all the transactions. If at any point during the transaction processing the balance becomes negative, the function should immediately return \\"ERROR\\" (quotes for clarity only). Function Signature: ```python def calculate_net_balance(transactions: List[Tuple[str, int]], initial_balance: int) -> Union[int, str]: ``` Input: - `transactions`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a string (`\'D\'` or `\'C\'`) and an integer (amount). - `initial_balance`: An integer representing the starting balance. Output: - Return the final balance as an integer if it remains non-negative after all transactions. - Return \\"ERROR\\" if the balance becomes negative at any point. Constraints: - The length of transactions list, `|transactions|`, will be between `1` and `10^5`. - The amount in each transaction will be between `1` and `10^4`. - The initial balance will be an integer in the range `0` to `10^7`.

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, \'A\' becomes \'B\', \'B\' becomes \'C\', and so on, wrapping around at the end of the alphabet. Thus, the word \\"HELLO\\" with a shift of 1 becomes \\"IFMMP\\". Your task is to implement the Caesar Cipher encryption method in the function `caesar_cipher(s, k)`. The function takes a string `s` and an integer `k`, which represents the shift value (positive means shifting right, negative means shifting left). The function should return the encrypted version of `s`. The function must handle both uppercase and lowercase letters efficiently without converting the case, and it should leave non-alphabetical characters unchanged. Some examples: ``` caesar_cipher(\\"HELLO\\", 1): returns \\"IFMMP\\". caesar_cipher(\\"hello\\", 3): returns \\"khoor\\". caesar_cipher(\\"Zebra!\\", 2): returns \\"Bgdtc!\\". caesar_cipher(\\"Cipher123\\", -3): returns \\"Zfmebo123\\". ``` Special Notes: - The shift value `k` can be positive or negative and could be larger than the length of the alphabet. - Use modulo operation to handle wrap around of the letters.","solution":"def caesar_cipher(s, k): Encrypts the input string s using Caesar Cipher with a shift of k.

Variables in MiniLang are identified by single lowercase letters. 2. `value` and `con` are integers (can be positive or negative). 3. The program starts with the first instruction and executes each line sequentially unless a conditional jump is made using `IF`. 4. The `IF` instruction evaluates a condition and executes the following block of instructions (`IF` block) if true. The block ends with an `ENDIF` command. 5.

Create a Library class: Library() Initializes the library with an empty collection of books, authors, and borrowers. void addBook(string ISBN, string title, string authorName, int count) Adds a book with the given ISBN, title, and author to the library. If the author is not already present in the library, they should be added. If the book is already present, it should update the count of available copies. void registerBorrower(string borrowerName) Registers a new borrower in the library system. If the borrower is already registered, do nothing. bool borrowBook(string borrowerName, string ISBN) Allows a borrower to borrow a book, if the book is available and the borrower is registered. Returns true if the borrowing is successful, otherwise false. bool returnBook(string borrowerName, string ISBN) Allows a borrower to return a borrowed book, if the borrower has it. Returns true if the return is successful, otherwise false. string[] listBooks() Returns a list representing the current collection of books in alphabetical order by title. string[] listBorrowers() Returns a list representing the current collection of borrowers in alphabetical order by name.

The warehouse is represented as a 2D grid where each cell can either be empty or contain a stack of goods. Each stack is identified by a unique ID and has a certain height representing the number of goods in the stack. The manager needs to perform the following operations: adding a stack of goods to an empty cell, removing an existing stack from a cell, moving a stack from one cell to another, and querying the total number of goods in a rectangular sub-region of the grid. Moreover, due to the space constraints, the manager wants to minimize the sum of distances over all required movements while keeping track of goods. Write a program that helps the manager efficiently track and optimize the storage of goods. Input The first row contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the number of rows and columns in the grid. The next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 50,000), which represents the number of operations performed. Each of the following q lines describes an operation. The operations are of four types: * \\"A x y h t\\" – Add a stack at cell (x, y) with height h and ID t (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m, 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, and t is a unique integer). * \\"R x y\\" – Remove the stack from cell (x, y) (only if it exists). * \\"M x1 y1 x2 y2\\" – Move the stack from cell (x1, y1) to cell (x2, y2) (only if (x2, y2) is empty). * \\"Q x1 y1 x2 y2\\" – Query the total number of goods in the rectangular sub-region spanning from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) (1 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ m).

The grid cells are either: - Empty cells that the robot can move through. - Charging stations where the robot can recharge its battery. Each charging station provides a certain number of units of battery charge. The robot consumes one unit of battery charge per move (up, down, left, right). You are given the coordinates (x, y) of the target, the initial battery charge startBattery, and a list of charging stations represented as stations[i] = [xi, yi, charge], indicating that there is a charging station at position (xi, yi) providing charge units of battery. What is the minimum number of charging stops the robot must make in order to reach its target position (x, y)? If the robot cannot reach the target, return -1. Note: - The robot cannot go out of grid bounds. - If the robot reaches a charging station with 0 battery left, it can still recharge. - If the robot reaches the target with 0 battery left, it is still considered to have successfully delivered the package. Example 1: Input: target = [2, 2], startBattery = 4, stations = [] Output: 0 Explanation: The robot can reach the target without recharging. Example 2: Input: target = [10, 10], startBattery = 5, stations = [[5, 5, 20]] Output: -1 Explanation: The robot cannot reach the target as the distance exceeds the initial battery charge and there are not enough charging stations along the way. Example 3: Input: target = [8, 8], startBattery = 15, stations = [[2, 2, 10], [4, 4, 5], [6, 6, 2]] Output: 0 Explanation: The robot starts with 15 battery units. It moves to (8, 8) directly spending 16 battery units, which is not possible. Hence, the robot would need to recharge. From the list of charging stations, it utilizes the one at location (2, 2) for recharging and then proceeds.
