The goal of the system is to ensure that drones take the most efficient path between multiple delivery points. Each delivery point can be represented as a node, and the connections (paths) between them are the edges of a graph. Each edge has an associated cost which denotes the cost of traveling between those two points. Sam needs to write a program that calculates the minimum cost to deliver all packages starting from a main distribution center and covering all delivery points exactly once (Traveling Salesman Problem). The cost to return back to the main distribution center should also be included. Given an adjacency matrix of costs between each pair of delivery points, the task is to find the minimum delivery cost to cover all points starting from the first node (index 0). # Input: - The input consists of multiple datasets, ending with a line containing a single zero. - Each dataset starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 12), representing the number of delivery points. - Followed by an n x n matrix of integers, where the value at the i-th row and j-th column represents the cost (c_{ij}) (1 ≤ (c_{ij}) ≤ 100), the cost to travel from point i to point j. # Output: For each dataset, output the minimum cost on a single line. # Example: Input: ``` 4 0 10 15 20 10 0 35 25 15 35 0 30 20 25 30 0 3 0 29 20 29 0 15 20 15 0 0 ``` Output: ``` 80 64 ``` **Explanation:** 1.

The language consists of variables, basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and assignment statements. Each expression or statement in the language is provided on a single line and your program must evaluate these lines accordingly. Definitions and Considerations: - A variable name starts with an alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters. - An assignment statement is of the form `variable = expression`. Spaces may appear around each component. - An expression can be a simple variable name, a number (positive or negative integer), or a combination of these using arithmetic operations. Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence. - The operations should follow standard precedence rules: parentheses > multiplication/division > addition/subtraction. Operations of the same precedence are evaluated left to right. - Division should be treated as integer division. Input: - The first part of the input is a set of initial variable values. Each line has the format `variable value`. - The first part ends with a line containing only the string `END OF INITIALIZATION`. - The second part contains expressions or assignments, one per line, to be evaluated as they appear in input. - The input ends with a single line containing the string `END OF EXPRESSIONS`.

If there are multiple possible assignments resulting in the same minimum maximum distance, choose the one that appears lexicographically earlier. Formally, determine whether assigning city A or city B as the capital results in minimizing the maximum travel distance for any individual resident. If both assignments result in the same maximum travel distance, assign the smaller city (based on the city number).

The operations are defined as follows: - `1 x y`: Update the element at index `x` to `y`. - `2 l r`: Output the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` inclusive. The index in the array starts from 1. Input The first line of input contains an integer `n`, which denotes the number of elements in the array. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that form the array. The third line contains an integer `q`, denoting the number of instructions. The next `q` lines each contain an instruction in one of the two formats described above. Output For each `2 l r` instruction, output the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` in a new line. Constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ array elements, y ≤ 10^9 1 ≤ l, r, x ≤ n Example Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 3 1 3 10 2 3 5 Output: 6 19 Explanation In the example, the array contains 5 elements. The first query asks for the sum of elements from index 1 to 3, which is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. The second operation updates the element at index 3 to `10`, so the array becomes `[1, 2, 10, 4, 5]`. The final query asks for the sum of elements from index 3 to 5, which is `10 + 4 + 5 = 19`.","solution":"class NumArray: def __init__(self, nums): Initialize the data structure with an array of integers. self.n = len(nums) self.nums = nums self.prefix_sum = [0] * (self.n + 1) for i in range(self.n): self.prefix_sum[i + 1] = self.prefix_sum[i] + nums[i] def update(self, index, val): Update the element at index to val. diff = val - self.nums[index] self.nums[index] = val for i in range(index + 1, self.n + 1): self.prefix_sum[i] += diff def sumRange(self, left, right): Return the sum of the subarray nums[left..right]. return self.prefix_sum[right + 1] - self.prefix_sum[left] def process_instructions(n, array, instructions): num_array = NumArray(array) results = [] for instruction in instructions: parts = instruction.split() op_code = int(parts[0]) if op_code == 1: index = int(parts[1]) - 1 value = int(parts[2]) num_array.update(index, value) elif op_code == 2: left = int(parts[1]) - 1 right = int(parts[2]) - 1 results.append(num_array.sumRange(left, right)) return results"},{"question":"You are given a grid of size NxM, where each cell can either be land or water.

The pattern for an n-layer sand clock is constructed in the following way: - For every layer i from 1 to n: - The central value (the fixed value) of the sand clock is i. - The values to the left of the central value decrease incrementally till 1. - The values to the right of the central value decrease incrementally till 1. For example, if `n = 3`, the sand clock of layer 3 should be: ``` 1 121 12321 121 1 ``` For example, if `n = 4`, the sand clock of layer 4 should be: ``` 1 121 12321 1234321 12321 121 1 ``` Your task is to generate such a sand clock pattern for a given input `n`.

Each of the next `t` sets of lines contains: - An integer `s_i`, representing the initial shield strength of the robot. - An integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), the number of attacks against the robot. - `m` integers describing the attack damage values. Output For each robot, output either: - \\"Shield intact with strength X\\" if after all attacks the shield still has a positive strength `X`. - \\"Robot took Y hit points of damage\\" if the shield breaks and the robot sustains `Y` points of damage.

Since the shield remains with a strength of 5, the output is \\"Shield intact with strength 5\\". For the second robot, the battles go as follows: - Attack 1: Shield decreases from 100 to 70. - Attack 2: Shield decreases from 70 to 30. - Attack 3: Shield decreases from 30 to 10. Since the shield remains with a strength of 10, the output is \\"Shield intact with strength 10\\". For the third robot, the battles go as follows: - Attack 1: Shield decreases from 20 to 15. - Attack 2: Shield decreases from 15 to 5. - Attack 3: Shield decreases to 0 and the robot takes 5 damage. (Shield breaks) - Attack 4: Since the shield is already broken, the robot takes 10 damage. - Attack 5: Since the shield is already broken, the robot takes another 10 damage.

The Morse dictionary is given, where each key represents a character from the alphabet (A-Z) or digits (0-9), and the corresponding value is the Morse code representation of that character. To simplify, the Morse code only contains periods (.) for dots, dashes (-) for long sounds, and spaces are used to separate individual Morse code characters in a sequence. The parser function must take two inputs: the Morse dictionary and a string that contains the sequence of Morse code to be translated. The function should return the corresponding decrypted English text. # Input The input consists of: 1. A dictionary `morse_dict` where the keys are strings representing alphabet characters (A-Z) and digits (0-9), and the values are strings representing Morse code. 2. A string `morse_code` which is the sequence of Morse code to be translated. The Morse code characters are separated by single spaces. # Output The function should output a single string which is the decrypted English text from the Morse code. # Examples Example 1: **Input:** ```python morse_dict = { \'A\': \'.-\', \'B\': \'-...\', \'C\': \'-.-.\', \'D\': \'-..\', \'E\': \'.\', \'F\': \'..-.\', \'G\': \'--.\', \'H\': \'....\', \'I\': \'..\', \'J\': \'.---\', \'K\': \'-.-\', \'L\': \'.-..\', \'M\': \'--\', \'N\': \'-.\', \'O\': \'---\', \'P\': \'.--.\', \'Q\': \'--.-\', \'R\': \'.-.\', \'S\': \'...\', \'T\': \'-\', \'U\': \'..-\', \'V\': \'...-\', \'W\': \'.--\', \'X\': \'-..-\', \'Y\': \'-.--\', \'Z\': \'--..\', \'0\': \'-----\', \'1\': \'.----\', \'2\': \'..---\', \'3\': \'...--\', \'4\': \'....-\', \'5\': \'.....\', \'6\': \'-....\', \'7\': \'--...\', \'8\': \'---..\', \'9\': \'----.\' } morse_code = \'.... . .-.. .-.. --- .-- --- .-. .-.. -..\' ``` **Output:** ``` \'HELLO WORLD\' ``` Example 2: **Input:** ```python morse_dict = { \'A\': \'.-\', \'B\': \'-...\', \'C\': \'-.-.\', \'D\': \'-..\', \'E\': \'.\', \'F\': \'..-.\', \'G\': \'--.\', \'H\': \'....\', \'I\': \'..\', \'J\': \'.---\', \'K\': \'-.-\', \'L\': \'.-..\', \'M\': \'--\', \'N\': \'-.\', \'O\': \'---\', \'P\': \'.--.\', \'Q\': \'--.-\', \'R\': \'.-.\', \'S\': \'...\', \'T\': \'-\', \'U\': \'..-\', \'V\': \'...-\', \'W\': \'.--\', \'X\': \'-..-\', \'Y\': \'-.--\', \'Z\': \'--..\', \'0\': \'-----\', \'1\': \'.----\', \'2\': \'..---\', \'3\': \'...--\', \'4\': \'....-\', \'5\': \'.....\', \'6\': \'-....\', \'7\': \'--...\', \'8\': \'---..\', \'9\': \'----.\' } morse_code = \'-- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. .\' ``` **Output:** ``` \'MORSE CODE\' ``` # Constraints - The Morse dictionary will have exactly 36 entries. - The input Morse code string will contain only valid Morse code as per the dictionary, including proper spaces for character separation. - The Morse code string will be less than or equal to 1000 characters in length.","solution":"def morse_to_text(morse_dict, morse_code): Translates a morse code string to regular English text using the provided morse dictionary.

Hash tables are widely used due to their efficient data retrieval characteristics. One challenge when implementing a hash table is resolving collisions, where multiple keys hash to the same index. A popular method to resolve collisions is Separate Chaining, where each bucket points to a linked list of elements that hash to the same index. Your task is to implement a simple hash table in Python using separate chaining. You need to create a `HashTable` class that supports the following methods: 1. **`__init__(self, size)`**: Initializes an empty hash table of given size. 2. **`insert(self, key, value)`**: Inserts a (key, value) pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, update its value. 3. **`get(self, key)`**: Returns the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist, return `None`. 4. **`remove(self, key)`**: Removes the key (and its associated value) from the hash table. If the key does not exist, do nothing. 5. **`__str__(self)`**: Returns a string representation of the hash table for easy visualization. Each bucket should be on a new line with the format: `index: [(key, value), (key, value), ...]`. For simplicity, you can use Python\'s built-in `hash()` function to compute the hash value of keys. Ensure your implementation handles common edge cases such as inserting duplicate keys, removing non-existent keys, and handling an empty table gracefully. # Input Format - The input starts with an integer `N` representing the number of operations to be performed. - Each of the following `N` lines specifies an operation in one of the following formats: `insert key value`, `get key`, `remove key`. # Output Format - For each `get` operation, print the value associated with the key. If the key does not exist, print `None`. - After all operations, print the string representation of the hash table. # Constraints - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ key, value ≤ 10^9 # Example Input ``` 8 insert 1 10 insert 2 20 get 1 get 3 insert 1 15 get 1 remove 1 get 1 ``` Output ``` 10 None 15 None 0: [(2, 20)] 1: [] 2: [] ...

The city consists of n intersections connected by m one-way roads. Due to budget constraints, Bob needs to minimize the number of roads to keep only essential ones while ensuring that it is still possible to travel from any intersection to any other intersection using the remaining roads. The traffic system can be described as a directed graph with n nodes (intersections) and m edges (one-way roads). Bob\'s goal is to determine whether it is possible to retain only a subset of the roads such that the resulting graph is still strongly connected (there is a path between any pair of nodes in both directions) and has the minimum number of roads. Input The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000; n − 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200000, n(n − 1))) — the number of intersections and the number of roads in the city, respectively. Then m lines follow, each line describing one of the roads in the city. The i-th line contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n; u_i ≠ v_i) denoting a one-way road from intersection u_i to the intersection v_i.

In ListLang, there are several operations that can be performed on lists. Each list is a sequence of integers. These operations are: 1. `append x L` - appends the integer `x` to the list `L`. 2. `extend L1 L2` - appends all items in list `L2` to the end of list `L1`. 3. `reverse L` - reverts the order of elements in the list `L`. 4. `typeof x L` - returns the type of the element at position `x` in the list `L` (either \\"int\\" if a valid index or \\"errtype\\" if the index is invalid). Sasha has provided you with a series of operations to be performed on initially empty lists. Your task is to simulate these operations and output the results for each `typeof` operation. Input The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of operations. Then follow `n` lines with one operation per line. Each operation is one of the four types specified above. When performing the `typeof x L` operation, the positions are 0-based indices. Output For each `typeof` operation, print the type of the element at position `x` in the list `L`.

In the second sample: - We start by adding 10 to list `B`, making it [10]. - Extending `B` with `C` doesn\'t change `B` as `C` is empty. - `typeof 0 B` is \\"int\\" because the element at index 0 is 10. - Extending `C` with `B` makes `C` [10]. - Reversing `C` results in [10] (no change). - `typeof 1 C` is \\"errtype\\" because there is no index 1 in list `C`.","solution":"def perform_operations(operations): Perform operations as described in the problem and return the results of `typeof` operations. lists = {} results = [] for operation in operations: op = operation.split() cmd = op[0] if cmd == \'append\': _, x, L = op x = int(x) if L not in lists: lists[L] = [] lists[L].append(x) elif cmd == \'extend\': _, L1, L2 = op if L1 not in lists: lists[L1] = [] if L2 in lists: lists[L1].extend(lists[L2]) elif cmd == \'reverse\': _, L = op if L in lists: lists[L].reverse() elif cmd == \'typeof\': _, x, L = op x = int(x) if L in lists and 0 <= x < len(lists[L]): results.append(\\"int\\") else: results.append(\\"errtype\\") return results"},{"question":"Peter is working on a complicated text editor that includes an auto-completion feature.

Each employee is rewarded based on their performance throughout the week. The company has recorded the daily performance of each employee for a whole week. Your task is to help calculate the total reward points each employee should receive. Performance is measured by an integer value (positive, zero, or negative) for each day of the week (7 days). The reward points are calculated as follows: 1. For each positive performance value, the employee receives reward points equal to the performance value. 2. For each zero performance value, the employee receives zero reward points. 3. For each negative performance value, a penalty is imposed, and the employee loses reward points equal to the absolute value of the performance (but the total reward points cannot go below zero).

Algoria consists of n farms located along a straight road, each at different distances from a central market. Each farm is represented by a three-element tuple (p, d, c), where p is the production rate, d is the distance from the market, and c is the corruption index of the farm. The goal of the government is to select the most productive farm (i.e., the one with the highest production rate), but there’s a catch: the selected farm should also be among those with the lowest corruption index. If there are multiple farms with the highest production rate, the farm with the smallest distance to the central market should be selected. If the distance is also the same, select the farm with the lowest corruption index. You\'re tasked with writing a program that determines which farm the government should prioritize for subsidies.

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single string that needs to be compressed. Input: The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a string that needs to be compressed. Output: For each test case, print the compressed string in a new line. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5 All strings consist only of lowercase English letters \'a\'-\'z\'.

The game involves taking turns to change elements in the array by adding or subtracting a value of 1 from any element. The objective of the game is to make all elements of the array equal. Alice always starts first, and they play optimally. You are to determine who will win the game, assuming both players play optimally. Note that the game terminates when all elements in the array are equal. Input The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of elements in the array. The second line contains the n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the array. Output Print \\"Alice\\" if Alice wins, or \\"Bob\\" if Bob wins. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 Output Alice Input 4 4 4 4 4 Output Bob Note In the first example, Alice can change the second element from 2 to 1. Now the array is [1, 1, 3]. Bob then changes the third element from 3 to 1. The array becomes [1, 1, 1]. Since Alice has no moves left, Alice wins. In the second example, all elements are already equal, so Bob wins by default as there are no moves to make.","solution":"def determine_winner(n, array): Determines the winner of the game between Alice and Bob based on the given rules.
