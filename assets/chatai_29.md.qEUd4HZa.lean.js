The function should be able to normalize the data before clustering, if specified. Function Specification: **Function Name:** `perform_kmeans_clustering` **Parameters:** - `data`: A 2-dimensional list of numerical values where each sub-list represents a data point. - `num_clusters`: An integer specifying the number of clusters. - `normalize`: A boolean indicating whether to normalize the data before clustering. **Returns:** - A dictionary containing the following keys: - `\'centroids\'`: A list of lists where each sub-list represents the coordinates of a cluster centroid. - `\'cluster_labels\'`: A list of integers where each value indicates the cluster label assigned to the corresponding data point. - `\'inertia\'`: A float representing the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. - `\'silhouette_score\'`: A float representing the mean Silhouette Coefficient of all samples. Details: 1. If `normalize` is `True`, scale the data such that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before performing clustering.

This means the function should treat \\"Listen\\" and \\"Silent\\" as anagrams. - Do not use any external libraries.

Each plant type grows at a different rate and requires a specific amount of water daily. Your task is to write a function that simulates the growth of plants over a given number of days, updating their height accordingly. # Function Requirements 1. Write a function named `simulate_growth` that accepts two parameters: `plants`, a list of dictionaries representing different plants, and `days`, an integer representing the number of days over which the simulation runs. 2. Each plant dictionary contains the following keys: - \\"name\\": The name of the plant as a string. - \\"initial_height\\": The initial height of the plant in centimeters as a float. - \\"growth_rate\\": The daily growth rate in centimeters as a float. - \\"daily_water_need\\": The amount of water the plant needs each day in liters as a float. 3. The function should iterate over each plant and update its height daily based on its growth rate. 4. If a plant doesn\'t receive the required amount of water for a day, it should not grow for that day. 5. Use random chance to determine if the plant receives enough water each day. The chance to receive the required water is determined by generating a random number between 0 and 19. If the number is less than 16, the plant receives enough water; otherwise, it doesn\'t. 6.

The function should take in two arguments: - `book_id` (an integer that uniquely identifies a book) - `update_cache` (a boolean flag indicating whether to update the cache with a fresh API call; defaults to `False`) The API endpoint to get book details is `https://api.onlinebookstore.com/book/{book_id}`, where `{book_id}` should be replaced with the actual book ID. # Requirements 1. **Implementation**: You need to implement a function with the following signature: ```python def get_book_details(book_id: int, update_cache: bool = False) -> dict: ``` 2. **Libraries**: You may use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests. # Example Usage: Assuming the `book_id` is 123: ```python book_details = get_book_details(123) print(book_details) # Should print the book details either from cache or from the API book_details = get_book_details(123, update_cache=True) print(book_details) # Should print the updated book details fetched from the API ``` # Notes: - Ensure the cache is updated only if `update_cache` is `True`. - The cache should be implemented as a dictionary where the keys are book IDs and values are the results from the API. - Handle possible exceptions from the API call (e.g., network errors, non-200 status codes) gracefully by returning an appropriate message or an empty dictionary.","solution":"import requests # In-memory cache dictionary cache = {} def get_book_details(book_id: int, update_cache: bool = False) -> dict: Fetches book details from the API or the cache.

The function should perform the following tasks: 1. **Define keyword lists:** - Create a list of positive keywords, such as `[\\"good\\", \\"happy\\", \\"joy\\", \\"excellent\\", \\"great\\", \\"fantastic\\", \\"positive\\"]`. - Create a list of negative keywords, such as `[\\"bad\\", \\"sad\\", \\"pain\\", \\"poor\\", \\"terrible\\", \\"negative\\"]`. 2. **Classify each sentence:** - For each sentence in the list, determine if it contains any of the positive or negative keywords. - If a sentence contains more positive keywords than negative keywords, classify it as \'positive\'. - If a sentence contains more negative keywords than positive keywords, classify it as \'negative\'. - If the counts are equal or no keywords are found, classify the sentence as \'neutral\'. 3. **Return the classifications:** - Return a list of classifications corresponding to each sentence, where each classification is either \'positive\', \'negative\', or \'neutral\'. **Function Signature:** ```python def classify_sentences(sentences: list) -> list: # Your code here ``` # Example: ```python sentences = [ \\"I am feeling very happy today because the weather is great.\\", \\"This is a bad day, I am sad all the time.\\", \\"The food is fantastic and the service is excellent.\\", \\"The movie was okay, not too good, not too bad.\\" ] print(classify_sentences(sentences)) # Output: [\'positive\', \'negative\', \'positive\', \'neutral\'] ```","solution":"def classify_sentences(sentences): def keyword_count(sentence, keywords): count = 0 for keyword in keywords: count += sentence.lower().count(keyword) return count positive_keywords = [\\"good\\", \\"happy\\", \\"joy\\", \\"excellent\\", \\"great\\", \\"fantastic\\", \\"positive\\"] negative_keywords = [\\"bad\\", \\"sad\\", \\"pain\\", \\"poor\\", \\"terrible\\", \\"negative\\"] classifications = [] for sentence in sentences: positive_count = keyword_count(sentence, positive_keywords) negative_count = keyword_count(sentence, negative_keywords) if positive_count > negative_count: classifications.append(\'positive\') elif negative_count > positive_count: classifications.append(\'negative\') else: classifications.append(\'neutral\') return classifications"},{"question":"In this problem, you are required to write a Python function named `list_directory_contents` that will perform the following actions: 1.

The function you need to implement is `process_trades(portfolio, trades)`, where `portfolio` is a dictionary representing the stocks held by the user, and `trades` is a list of commands that affect the portfolio. Each trade command is a string formatted as follows: 1. **Buy Command (\\"buy {symbol} {quantity} {price}\\")**: - Adds the specified quantity of the stock at the given price to the portfolio. - If the stock already exists in the portfolio, increase the quantity held and adjust the average price. 2. **Sell Command (\\"sell {symbol} {quantity} {price}\\")**: - Removes the specified quantity of the stock at the given price from the portfolio. - If the stock does not exist or there is not enough quantity to sell, ignore the command. 3. **Query Command (\\"query {symbol}\\")**: - Returns the current quantity and average price of the specified stock in the portfolio. Assume that all input values are valid, but trades may affect stocks that are not initially in the portfolio. The average price should be calculated using the total spent on the stock divided by the total quantity. Here is a sample implementation to get you started: ```python def process_trades(portfolio, trades): for trade in trades: parts = trade.split() command = parts[0] symbol = parts[1] if command == \\"buy\\": quantity = int(parts[2]) price = float(parts[3]) if symbol in portfolio: old_quantity, old_price = portfolio[symbol] new_quantity = old_quantity + quantity new_price = (old_price * old_quantity + price * quantity) / new_quantity portfolio[symbol] = (new_quantity, new_price) else: portfolio[symbol] = (quantity, price) elif command == \\"sell\\": quantity = int(parts[2]) if symbol in portfolio: old_quantity, old_price = portfolio[symbol] if old_quantity >= quantity: new_quantity = old_quantity - quantity if new_quantity == 0: del portfolio[symbol] else: portfolio[symbol] = (new_quantity, old_price) elif command == \\"query\\": if symbol in portfolio: quantity, price = portfolio[symbol] print(f\\"{symbol}: {quantity} shares at an average price of {price:.2f}\\") else: print(f\\"{symbol}: not found in portfolio\\") # Example usage: portfolio = {\'AAPL\': (50, 150.0)} trades = [ \\"buy AAPL 20 160.0\\", \\"buy GOOGL 15 1000.0\\", \\"sell AAPL 10 155.0\\", \\"query AAPL\\", \\"query GOOGL\\", \\"query MSFT\\" ] process_trades(portfolio, trades) ``` **Requirements:** - Ensure the averaged price calculation is correct when buying more shares. - When selling more shares than owned, the command should be ignored. - Output the results of query commands as specified.","solution":"def process_trades(portfolio, trades): results = [] for trade in trades: parts = trade.split() command = parts[0] symbol = parts[1] if command == \\"buy\\": quantity = int(parts[2]) price = float(parts[3]) if symbol in portfolio: old_quantity, old_price = portfolio[symbol] new_quantity = old_quantity + quantity new_price = (old_price * old_quantity + price * quantity) / new_quantity portfolio[symbol] = (new_quantity, new_price) else: portfolio[symbol] = (quantity, price) elif command == \\"sell\\": quantity = int(parts[2]) price = float(parts[3]) if symbol in portfolio: old_quantity, old_price = portfolio[symbol] if old_quantity >= quantity: new_quantity = old_quantity - quantity if new_quantity == 0: del portfolio[symbol] else: portfolio[symbol] = (new_quantity, old_price) elif command == \\"query\\": if symbol in portfolio: quantity, price = portfolio[symbol] results.append(f\\"{symbol}: {quantity} shares at an average price of {price:.2f}\\") else: results.append(f\\"{symbol}: not found in portfolio\\") return results"}]'),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:I,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},Y={key:1};function j(a,e,l,m,r,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),_(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",R,[(n(!0),i(w,null,b(s.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(p,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",P,' No results found for "'+d(r.searchQuery)+'".
