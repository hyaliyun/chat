If \'opposite\', \'adjacent\', or \'hypotenuse\' is unknown, it will be represented by the string `\\"?\\"`. The function should return the unknown side\'s length as a float. Input - `opposite` (float|string): The length of the side opposite the right angle or \\"?\\" if unknown. - `adjacent` (float|string): The length of the side adjacent to the right angle or \\"?\\" if unknown. - `hypotenuse` (float|string): The length of the hypotenuse or \\"?\\" if unknown. Output - The length of the unknown side as a float. Constraints - Only one of the sides will ever be unknown. - If all sides are known, return a string \\"All sides are already known\\". - Input values other than \\"?\\" must be positive floats or integers. - Raise a `ValueError` for invalid inputs that do not form a valid right-angled triangle. Edge Cases - Ensure proper handling when multiple sides are passed as \\"?\\". - Validate inputs to avoid invalid triangles. Example ```python # Example 1 assert calculate_missing_side(3, 4, \\"?\\") == 5.0 # Hypotenuse # Example 2 assert calculate_missing_side(\\"?\\", 5, 13) == 12.0 # Opposite # Example 3 assert calculate_missing_side(8, \\"?\\", 10) == 6.0 # Adjacent # Example 4 assert calculate_missing_side(3, 4, 5) == \\"All sides are already known\\" ``` Note Raise `ValueError`s for cases where: - Negative or zero length sides are provided. - More than one side is unknown. - Provided dimensions do not form a valid right-angled triangle.","solution":"import math def calculate_missing_side(opposite, adjacent, hypotenuse): Calculates the length of the missing side of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

Each element must have the same probability of being returned. Input and Output Format: - Method `insert(val: int) -> bool` * Input: A single integer value `val`. * Output: A boolean indicating success (`True`) or failure (`False`) of the insertion. - Method `remove(val: int) -> bool` * Input: A single integer value `val`. * Output: A boolean indicating success (`True`) or failure (`False`) of the deletion. - Method `random_element() -> int` * Output: A single integer which is a randomly chosen element from the set. Constraints: - The value of `val` to be inserted can be any integer. - Each operation should support average time complexity of O(1). - Handle edge cases like removing elements that do not exist and querying from empty sets gracefully. **Tips:** - Use a combination of a list and a hash map to manage elements and their indices. - Ensure uniform probability when returning a random element.

The core advantage of a circular queue over a traditional queue (like a linear array-based queue) is the reusability of vacant positions freed by dequeue operations. Unlike the linear queue, a circular queue does not have the issue of unused spaces. Requirements: Implement a Circular Queue as a class `CircularQueue` that inherits from `AbstractQueue`. Include the following methods: * **__init__(self, capacity)**: Initializes the queue with the given capacity. * **enqueue(self, value)**: Adds a new element to the rear of the queue. Raises an exception if the queue is full. * **dequeue(self)**: Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Raises an exception if the queue is empty. * **peek(self)**: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it. Raises an exception if the queue is empty. * **is_empty(self)**: Returns `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. * **is_full(self)**: Returns `True` if the queue is full, `False` otherwise. * **__iter__(self)**: Iterates through the queue elements in FIFO order. Input: * An integer `capacity` when initializing the queue. * Integers/strings for `enqueue`. * No input for `dequeue`, `peek`, `is_empty`, `is_full`. Output: * Methods `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek` do not return any output. * `__iter__` should allow looping through the queue elements in FIFO order. * Methods `is_empty` and `is_full` return boolean values. Constraints: * `1 <= capacity <= 1000` * Operations should be efficient, adhering to expected time complexities.

A new feature requires comparing two different versions of a document to determine the minimum number of delete operations needed to make them identical. This scenario can be related to functionalities such as auto-merging changes or finding differences between documents. Problem Statement You need to implement a function that finds the minimum number of delete operations to make two strings identical.

Performance Requirements - Your solution should have a time complexity of O(m*n) where m and n are the lengths of the strings. - Your solution should have a space complexity of O(m*n). Example ```python assert min_deletions_to_equal(\\"sea\\", \\"eat\\") == 2 ``` Explanation: You need one step to make \\"sea\\" to \\"ea\\" and another step to make \\"eat\\" to \\"ea\\".

Its primary use case is in scenarios where the cost of writing data is expensive. Given its nature, however, it typically isn\'t efficient for large datasets due to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2). Problem Statement Implement the `cycle_sort_revised` function that sorts a provided list in ascending order using the Cycle Sort algorithm. While maintaining a low number of write operations, ensure it handles key edge cases, including when an array is fully sorted, has duplicates, or has all identical elements.

Output: * A list of integers sorted in ascending order. Constraints: * Your algorithm should operate in-place with O(1) additional space. * While you can\'t guarantee sub-quadratic time, you should achieve the task within the range of typical O(N^2) sorting behavior.
