Alice provides you with the following types of queries: 1. Water the plants in a specific segment: `1 l r x` - add `x` to the height of each plant from pot `l` to pot `r` (inclusive). 2. Find the maximum plant height: `2` - return the maximum height of all the plants in the array. # Input The first line of the input contains two integers `n` and `q` (1 leq n, q leq 100,000) — the number of plant pots and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains `n` integers `h_i` (1 leq h_i leq 1,000,000) — the initial heights of the plants in each pot. The following `q` lines describe the queries. Each query is one of the two types mentioned above. # Output For each query of type `2`, print the maximum plant height after processing all previous queries. # Example Input ``` 5 5 2 3 1 5 4 1 1 3 2 2 1 2 4 1 2 1 3 5 3 2 ``` Output ``` 5 6 8 ``` # Explanation - After the first query `1 1 3 2`, the plant heights become `[4, 5, 3, 5, 4]`. - The first query of type `2` returns `5` since the height of the tallest plant is 5. - After the second query `1 2 4 1`, the plant heights become `[4, 6, 4, 6, 4]`. - The second query of type `2` returns `6`. - After the third query `1 3 5 3`, the plant heights become `[4, 6, 7, 9, 7]`. - The third query of type `2` returns `9`.","solution":"def process_queries(n, q, heights, queries): results = [] for query in queries: if query[0] == 1: l, r, x = query[1], query[2], query[3] for i in range(l-1, r): heights[i] += x elif query[0] == 2: results.append(max(heights)) return results"},{"question":"You are given a rectangular grid with n rows and m columns.

It is essential to make queries and get responses in real-time, so ensure you use stream flushing operations after outputting each query to avoid buffering issues. For example, in Python, you can use `sys.stdout.flush()`. History Check is a game where two players attempt to guess an ancient year based on certain clues. The first player thinks of a secret year in the range 1000 to 9999 inclusive. The second player tries to guess the secret year, with the first player providing feedback about the accuracy of each guess using specific clues. The feedback is based on the positions of the digits in the year and the actual digits themselves. If a digit is in the correct position, it is counted as a \'match\'. If a digit exists in the secret year but is in the wrong position, it is counted as a \'misplaced\'. The sum of \'match\' and \'misplaced\' provides the total number of correct digits, providing valuable information to zero in on the secret year. For example, consider the secret year is \\"1987\\", and the guess is \\"1890\\": - The digit \'1\' is a match. - The digit \'8\' is misplaced. - The digits \'9\' and \'0\' do not match. So, the response would be 1 \'match\' and 1 \'misplaced\', totaling 2 correct digits. In this problem, you need to guess the secret year chosen by the system. You are allowed to make up to 10 guesses. Each guess should be a 4-digit year in the range 1000 to 9999 inclusive. You can make queries to the testing system, each query being a single 4-digit year string. The answer to the query is given in pairs of integers in the form \\"matches misplaced\\". For instance, if the system responds with \\"2 1\\", it means there are 2 digits in the correct position and 1 digit which is correct but in the wrong position. Example: - Secret year: \\"1945\\" - Guess: \\"1495\\" - Response: \\"2 2\\" (since \'1\' and \'4\' are matches, and \'9\' and \'5\' are misplaced) When your program receives \\"4 0\\" as a response, it means you have correctly guessed the year, and the program should terminate. If the program exceeds 10 guesses or makes an invalid guess (e.g., enters a number outside the range 1000-9999), it should handle the error accordingly and exit gracefully. Your task is to create a program that will perform this guessing game effectively within the constraint of 10 queries. After each guess you make, your program must flush the output and read the system\'s response before making the next guess. The program\'s input/output interaction format is as follows: 1. You output a 4-digit year guess. 2. The system responds with the number of matches and misplaced digits. 3. You use this information to make further guesses. Ensure your program follows the mentioned constraints and terminates correctly after guessing the year or when the maximum number of guesses is exhausted. To read responses from the system, use the standard input. The program should print queries — 4-digit year strings, one per line, and flush the output stream after each query.","solution":"import sys def guess_secret_year(): # Define initial possible year and the range of guesses guess = 1000 # Number of attempts attempts = 0 while attempts < 10: # Output the guessed year print(guess) sys.stdout.flush() # Ensure we\'re not buffering outputs # Read response from the system response = input().strip() # Parse the response matches, misplaced = map(int, response.split()) # If all 4 digits match, we\'ve found the secret year if matches == 4: return # Increment the guess and the number of attempts guess += 1 attempts += 1 if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": guess_secret_year()"},{"question":"You are given a grid-based minefield represented by a matrix, where `M[i][j]` is the number of mines in the cell (i, j).

Can you help Tanya guess the binary string by asking a series of questions and analyzing the responses? The only line contains the integer n (3 le n le 2048) — the length of the binary string. To ask a question, print \\"? l r\\" (without quotes) where 1 le l le r le n. Tanya then needs to read the answer, which will be the number of \'1\'s in the substring s[l ldots r]. If Tanya asks more than the allowed number of questions or makes an invalid query, Alex will respond with -1, indicating that she has exceeded the number of queries or made an invalid query. To submit the final guess, Tanya should print \\"! s\\" (without quotes), where s is the binary string she thinks Alex was thinking. Note that answering doesn\'t count as one of the allowed questions. After printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get an idleness limit exceeded verdict. To do this, use: ```python import sys sys.stdout.flush() ``` Hacks: The first line contains the integer n (3 le n le 2048) — the length of the binary string. The second line contains a binary string s of length n consisting only of characters \'0\' and \'1\'. In the first sample, the binary string is \\"110\\". Tanya starts by asking about the substring from index 1 to 2 (\\"110\\"[1:2] = \\"11\\"), and Alex replies with 2. Tanya then asks about the substring from index 2 to 3 (\\"110\\"[2:3] = \\"10\\"), and Alex replies with 1. Finally, Tanya asks about the substring from index 1 to 3 (\\"110\\"[1:3] = \\"110\\"), and Alex replies with 2. Tanya can then deduce the binary string.","solution":"import math import sys from typing import List def make_query(substring: str) -> int: return substring.count(\'1\') def guess_binary_string(s: str) -> str: n = len(s) guessed_string = [\'0\'] * n # Determine the number of queries we can make max_queries = round(n * math.log2(n)) # Perform the queries and recover the string for i in range(n): guessed_string[i] = \'1\' if make_query(s[i:i+1]) == 1 else \'0\' return \'\'.join(guessed_string)"},{"question":"You are given two strings, s and t, composed of lowercase English letters.

You need to help Alice by writing a program to perform these queries efficiently. Input: - The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph. - Each of the next m lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — denoting a directed edge from node a to node b. - The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1000) — the number of queries. - Each of the next q lines contains three integers t, u, and v (1 ≤ t ≤ 2, 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing a query. - If t = 1, check if there is a path from node u to node v. - If t = 2, find the shortest path length from node u to node v. Output: - For each query of type 1, print \\"YES\\" if there is a path from node u to node v, otherwise print \\"NO\\". - For each query of type 2, print the shortest path length from node u to node v, or -1 if there is no path.

For each machine, you are given time-series sensor data collected from various sensors installed on the machines. Your goal is to build a model that can estimate the remaining useful life of the machines before they fail. Background In industrial settings, preventive maintenance is crucial to avoid unexpected machine failures that could lead to significant downtime and financial losses. By accurately predicting the remaining useful life of machines, maintenance can be scheduled optimally, reducing the risk of machine failures and improving operational efficiency. You are provided with the following datasets: - `train.csv`: Contains historical sensor data for a set of machines along with the actual remaining useful life at each timestamp. - `test.csv`: Contains historical sensor data for a different set of machines, for which you need to predict the remaining useful life. - `RUL.csv`: Contains the actual remaining useful life for the machines in the `test.csv` file, which can be used to evaluate your predictions after the competition ends. Each file has the following format: - `train.csv`: - `machine_id`: Unique identifier for each machine. - `timestamp`: The time at which the sensor data was recorded. - `sensor_1`, `sensor_2`, ..., `sensor_n`: Readings from various sensors installed on the machine. - `RUL`: The remaining useful life of the machine at the given timestamp. - `test.csv`: - `machine_id`: Unique identifier for each machine. - `timestamp`: The time at which the sensor data was recorded. - `sensor_1`, `sensor_2`, ..., `sensor_n`: Readings from various sensors installed on the machine. - `RUL.csv`: - `machine_id`: Unique identifier for each machine in the `test.csv` file. - `RUL`: The actual remaining useful life of the machine. Please note that the sensor data may contain some noise or missing values, so you might need to preprocess the data before building your model. Your task is to build a predictive model that can estimate the RUL for each machine in the `test.csv` file and submit your predictions in the following format: `submission.csv`: - `machine_id`: Unique identifier for each machine in the `test.csv` file. - `RUL`: Your estimated remaining useful life for the machine. Your score will be determined using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between your predictions and the actual RUL values provided in the `RUL.csv` file: text{RMSE} = sqrt{frac{1}{N} sum_{i=1}^N left( text{RUL}_{i,text{pred}} - text{RUL}_{i,text{true}} right)^2} where: - text{RUL}_{i,text{pred}} is the predicted RUL for machine i. - text{RUL}_{i,text{true}} is the actual RUL for machine i. - N is the number of machines in the `test.csv` file. Judging The problem A contains the tests from the `train.csv` data. The answers for the training data are open but you may submit your answers if you want. This problem is only for testing your solutions and will be hidden before the official system testing. The problem B contains the tests from the `test.csv` data. Your solutions will be judged and scored immediately after each submission. Use this problem to estimate the quality of your approach. This problem will be hidden before the official system testing. The problem C contains the final evaluation tests which will be used to determine the winners. Your submissions will not be judged during the contest, however the format of submissions will still be checked. Any well-formed submission will receive 0 points during the contest. After the contest, for each participant we will use the latest well-formed (0 points) submission on the problem C to rejudge it and calculate the scores.

Each checkpoint has a unique ID and is passed by multiple rally cars. Each car has a unique ID and contains a GPS device that logs the IDs of the checkpoints it passes. Sometimes, multiple GPS logs of the same car get corrupted and contain duplicate entries of the same checkpoint. Your task is to process the GPS logs for each car and remove any duplicate checkpoint entries to ensure the logs are accurate. Additionally, you need to determine how many unique checkpoints each car has passed. The input consists of an integer n (1 le n le 200), which represents the number of cars. The following n lines each contain logs for one car. Each log starts with an integer m (1 le m le 200) indicating the number of checkpoints recorded in the log, followed by m integers representing the checkpoint IDs passed by the car.

The server maintains a list of files and their associated attributes (e.g., last modified time, size), which are stored in a dictionary. For the sync process, the client sends a list of files available on the local machine and their attributes in a dictionary format to the server. The server needs to identify which files are: 1. Only present on the server (to be deleted on the server), 2. Only present on the client (to be uploaded from the client to the server), 3. Present on both but with different attributes (to be updated on the server using the client\'s version). Write a function `file_sync(server_files, client_files)` that takes in two dictionaries: - `server_files` representing the files on the server. - `client_files` representing the files on the client. Each dictionary\'s keys are the filenames and values are another dictionary containing \'last_modified\' (a string in \\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\\" format) and \'size\' (an integer representing file size in bytes).

Each conveyor operates on a schedule defined by its length and speed. The king wants to know the minimum amount of time required to get jewels from a selection of mines to the castle. Given n conveyors, where each conveyor i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) connects a mine to the castle, and is defined by its length li (1 ≤ li ≤ 10^5) and speed si (1 ≤ si ≤ 10^4). The time ti required for conveyor i to transport jewels is given by the formula ti = li / si.

They have designed a set of autonomous rovers that will execute a series of tasks to gather data and perform analyses. Each rover has a task queue, and each task takes a specific amount of time to complete. Additionally, each task has a dependency that determines the minimum amount of fuel a rover needs to start that task. The challenge the scientists face is to minimize the total time taken for all rovers to complete their tasks, adhering to their dependencies. Each rover can operate independently, meaning tasks assigned to one rover do not interfere with the tasks of another rover. However, tasks cannot be reordered within the task queue of a single rover due to strict sequential dependencies. The problem is defined as follows: - You have m rovers, each rover has a list of tasks. The i-th rover has ti tasks. - Each task of each rover is described by two integers di,j and fi,j where di,j (1 ≤ di,j ≤ 1000) is the duration of time in minutes needed to complete the task and fi,j (1 ≤ fi,j ≤ 1000) is the minimum fuel required to start the task j in rover i’s task list. The tasks of a single rover must be executed in the given order. Your objective is to determine the minimum total time required for all rovers to finish all their tasks. # Input: - The first line contains integer m — the number of rovers. - Each of the following m lines contains ti integers representing the number of tasks for the i-th rover. - For the next m blocks, there are ti lines for each rover. Each of those lines contains two integers di,j and fi,j representing the duration and the minimum start fuel requirement for the corresponding task. # Output: - Print a single number — the minimum total time required for all the rovers to complete their tasks. # Example: Input: ``` 2 3 2 5 10 3 15 2 20 4 25 8 30 ``` Output: ``` 10 ``` Explanation: - Rover 1 has 3 tasks with durations 5, 3, and 2 minutes respectively. - Rover 2 has 2 tasks with durations 4 and 8 minutes respectively. - Total time = max(5+3+2, 4+8) = max(10, 12) = 12 minutes. However, there\'s no specific condition about optimizing the order as the tasks must be completed in the given order. Hence, the total time required is the maximum of the sums of each rover\'s task durations = 12 minutes. In this task example, the problem assumes that each rover works on its task independently while the sum of individual task times for each rover determines the total time for that rover. The answer is the maximum of these times.","solution":"def min_total_time(m, tasks): Calculate the minimum total time required for all rovers to finish all their tasks.

Given two integers m and n (1 le m, n le 100), write a function that returns the number of unique paths that Selena, Shiro, and Katie can take in the forest. For example: - If the grid size is 3x2, there are 3 unique paths: 1. Right -> Right -> Down 2. Right -> Down -> Right 3. Down -> Right -> Right - If the grid size is 7x3, there are 28 unique paths. Write a function `unique_paths(m, n)` that calculates the number of unique paths on an m times n grid. **Function Signature:** ```python def unique_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int: # your code here ``` **Example Inputs and Outputs:** ``` unique_paths(3, 2) Output: 3 unique_paths(7, 3) Output: 28 ```","solution":"def unique_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int: Returns the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an m x n grid, moving only down or right at any point in time. # Create a 2D array (list of lists) with m rows and n columns dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)] # Iterate through the grid starting from (1, 1) for i in range(1, m): for j in range(1, n): dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] # The bottom-right corner will have our answer return dp[m-1][n-1]"},{"question":"You have recently joined a new social network called \\"FriendCircle.\\" There are n users in FriendCircle (numbered 1 through n), and some pairs of users are friends.

The clock shows time in the format \\"HH:MM\\" where HH represents hours and MM represents minutes. The temperature is displayed right after the time, formatted as \\"+XX°C\\" or \\"-XX°C\\" where XX is the temperature in degrees Celsius. You need to implement a function that adjusts the display based on a set of inputs according to the following rules: 1.

Given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, with each node having a specific \\"importance\\" rating, Astoria wants to find a path in the graph that starts from a designated node s, ends at a designated node t, and visits each node exactly once. While doing this, she wants to maximize the sum of the importance ratings of the nodes visited.
