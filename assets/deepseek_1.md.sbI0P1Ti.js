Each chamber has a unique security level s, and each pipe has a length l and a security restriction r, denoting the minimum security level required to pass through the pipe. The pipes form a connected network, allowing movement between any two chambers. To conduct experiments involving various chemicals, the researchers often need to transport materials between chambers. The transport process must always follow the shortest path between the starting and destination chambers. There is a catch: the transport materials must satisfy the security restriction of each pipe they pass through. The researchers will conduct q transport operations. Each transport operation consists of moving materials from a starting chamber u to a destination chamber v. The researchers wish to determine the maximum security level required by any pipe along the shortest path from u to v. This information is critical because they need to ensure that the materials being transported meet all security requirements. Input The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 200, 1 ≤ q ≤ 200), representing the number of chambers and the number of transport operations, respectively.

Each trade stall can be categorized into one of the k different types. The stalls need to be arranged in such a way that stalls of different types are grouped together, forming k distinct clusters. As the organizer, your task is to ensure that the stalls are arranged optimally. You are given a large rectangular grid of size n×m representing the hall, where each cell can hold exactly one trade stall. Each stall requires exactly one cell of the grid. The stall types are numbered from 1 to k, and you can assume that each type has a sufficient number of stalls available to use. Your goal is to arrange the stalls in such a way that each cluster is as compact as possible, i.e., the stall types should form contiguous blocks in the grid. Additionally, the clustering should ensure that there is no unnecessary fragmentation within the clusters. For example, if there are k=3 types of stalls and a grid of size 5×5, an optimal arrangement might look like this: ``` 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ``` Here, types 1, 2, and 3 form contiguous clusters. ---Input--- The input contains a single test case: - The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 le n, m le 100, 1 le k le min(n, m)) – the dimensions of the grid and the number of types of trade stalls, respectively. ---Output--- Output n lines, each containing m integers, representing the grid filled with types of trade stalls.

A customer comes to the vending machine with an array `request[]` of types of candies they want and another array `required[]` representing the quantity of each respective type. Write a function `canServeAllRequests` that determines if the vending machine can fulfill the customer\'s entire request. Function Signature: ```python def canServeAllRequests(candies: List[int], quantity: List[int], request: List[int], required: List[int]) -> bool: ``` Example 1: ``` Input: candies = [1, 2, 3], quantity = [5, 3, 2], request = [1, 2], required = [4, 2] Output: True ``` Example 2: ``` Input: candies = [1, 2, 3], quantity = [2, 3, 1], request = [1, 2, 3], required = [1, 4, 1] Output: False ``` Explanation: 1. In Example 1, the vending machine has 5 candies of type 1 and 3 candies of type 2. The customer wants 4 candies of type 1 and 2 candies of type 2, which the machine can fulfill. 2. In Example 2, the vending machine has 2 candies of type 1, 3 candies of type 2, and 1 candy of type 3. The customer wants 1 candy of type 1, 4 candies of type 2, and 1 candy of type 3. The machine cannot fulfill 4 candies of type 2, therefore the output is False. Your Task: You need to implement the function `canServeAllRequests()` which takes four arguments - two lists `candies` and `quantity` representing the candy types and their quantities in the machine, and two lists `request` and `required`, representing the customer\'s requested candy types and their respective required quantities. Return True if the vending machine can serve the entire request, otherwise, return False. Expected Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m is the size of `candies` and n is the size of `request`. Expected Auxiliary Space: O(m).

The treasure locations can be translated and scaled with respect to one map. Your task is to determine which coordinates on one map correspond to which coordinates on the other map, indicating the location of the same treasure. Input The first line of the input contains an integer N (500 ≤ N ≤ 20000) – the number of treasures. The second line of the input contains an integer M1 (N ≤ M1 ≤ 1.2·N) – the number of coordinates marked on the first map. The next M1 lines contain the coordinates of the locations on the first map.

If there is no increase at any point in the data, the longest period is considered to be of length 1 (a single hour). Write a program that takes an integer n representing the number of hours in a day and an array of n integers representing the number of items viewed each hour. The program should output the length of the longest period of continuous increase in user activity. Input - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of hours in a day. - The second line contains n integers representing the number of items viewed each hour. Output - Print a single integer representing the length of the longest period of continuous increase in user activity.

Another period of continuous increase is from hour 4 to hour 5, but it is shorter than the first one. In the second example, there is no increase at any point, so the longest period is 1 hour. In the third example, the number of items viewed continuously increases through all hours, so the longest period is 8 hours.","solution":"def longest_continuous_increase(n, views): if n == 0: return 0 if n == 1: return 1 longest_increase = 1 current_increase = 1 for i in range(1, n): if views[i] > views[i - 1]: current_increase += 1 if current_increase > longest_increase: longest_increase = current_increase else: current_increase = 1 return longest_increase"},{"question":"Alex has recently begun exploring data structures and is particularly interested in arrays.

The palace is represented as an undirected graph with `n` rooms and `m` corridors. Each corridor connects two rooms and has a certain length. Amara needs to determine if she can reach from the entrance room to the throne room, considering that some rooms in the palace are locked and inaccessible. You are given the palace description, the entrance room, the throne room, and a list of locked rooms. Your task is to find the shortest path from the entrance room to the throne room if it exists, while ignoring all locked rooms. If no path exists, you need to indicate that. **Input:** - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rooms and the number of corridors, respectively. - Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9) — indicating there\'s a corridor between room `u` and room `v` with length `w`. - The next line contains two integers `e` and `t` (1 ≤ e, t ≤ n) — the entrance room and the throne room. - The next line contains an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n-1) — the number of locked rooms. - The last line contains `k` integers representing the indices of the locked rooms. **Output:** If there exists a path from the entrance room to the throne room that avoids locked rooms, output the length of the shortest path.

Each piece of equipment has a different base rental cost per day. There are also discounts given based on the number of days the equipment is rented. The discount rules are as follows: - If rented for 1 to 5 days, no discount. - If rented for 6 to 10 days, a 5% discount is applied to the base rental cost. - If rented for more than 10 days, a 10% discount is applied to the base rental cost. However, there\'s a special condition where if the total cost (before any discount) is above 100 units of currency, an additional 10% discount is given on the final cost after applying the duration-based discount.

For the third test case, the rental is for 12 days. The base cost is 12 * 12 = 144.00. A 10% discount for more than 10 days is applied, so it becomes 144 - 144 * 0.1 = 129.60.

Each test case consists of two lines: - The first line contains the string s (1 le |s| le 100). - The second line contains the string t (1 le |t| le 100). It is guaranteed that the strings `s` and `t` can be combined to form at least one valid string `u`. ------Output------ For each test case, output the shortest possible string `u` such that `s` is a prefix and `t` is a suffix. If there are multiple valid answers, output any of them. ------Examples------ Input 3 prefi suffix abcd cdef hello world Output prefixsuffix abcdef helloworld Note: In the first example, you can concatenate `s` and `t` directly to form the string `prefixsuffix`. In the second example, you find the intersection `cd` in `s` and `t` and merge to get `abcdef`.

The lab comprises several rooms connected by one-way corridors. The event starts in the main entrance room, room number 1, and each participant must navigate through the various rooms using the corridors to find the ultimate treasure located in the final room, room number N. While navigating, participants can collect keys located in specific rooms. Each key unlocks one or more corridors, allowing further access to other rooms. The goal is to determine if a participant can reach the treasure room starting from room 1 and collect all available keys on the way. Participants cannot backtrack; once they decide to leave a room, they cannot return. Due to the nature of the event, not all keys are necessary to reach the treasure, but collecting all of them is highly encouraged for a bonus prize.
