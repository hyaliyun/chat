For this, they\'ve devised an algorithm that utilizes the concept of the shortest path in graph theory to recommend friends. Each user in the social network is represented as a unique node in an undirected graph, and each friendship is represented as an edge connecting two nodes. The distance between two users is the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them. The idea is to recommend friends who are exactly two steps away, i.e., friends of friends who are not already directly connected. However, to avoid overwhelming users with too many suggestions, the platform limits the number of recommendations to the one with the highest average number of connections among the candidates. Write a program that, given the network of users and their connections, outputs the recommended friend for each user based on the aforementioned algorithm. Input The first line contains two integers N and M, separated by space, where N is the number of users (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and M is the number of friendships (0 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2).

The grid is an `n x m` matrix where some cells are empty, and others contain obstacles. Eva can move up, down, left, or right but cannot pass through obstacles. Additionally, Eva can use a special move to teleport to any cell within a specified distance `d` as long as the destination cell is empty. Eva starts at the top-left cell of the grid (0, 0) and needs to reach the bottom-right cell (n-1, m-1). She can use the normal move or the teleportation move optimally to minimize the number of moves required. Write a program to help Eva find the minimum number of moves from (0, 0) to (n-1, m-1). Input The first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `d` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 1 ≤ d ≤ 100) — the number of rows, columns, and the maximum distance Eva can teleport. The next `n` lines each contain `m` characters representing the grid. A character \'.\' denotes an empty cell, and \'#\' denotes an obstacle. It is guaranteed that both the starting cell (0, 0) and the destination cell (n-1, m-1) are empty. Output Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves required to reach the bottom-right cell.

It can only be created if it does not already exist in the file system. * `cd [dir]` - Change the current directory to `[dir]`. This command is invalid if `[dir]` does not exist in the current directory. * `cd ..` - Change the current directory to its parent directory. The root directory does not have a parent directory, so this command cannot be executed when the current directory is the root. * `ls` - List the contents (directories followed by files) of the current directory in lexicographical order, each name on a new line. * `pwd` - Print the current path from the root directory to the current directory, separated by `/`, starting with the root which is just `/`. Initially, you are in the root directory. Input - The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of commands. - The next `n` lines each contain a single command. Output - For each `ls` and `pwd` command, print the appropriate output based on the current state of the file system. Example Input 12 mkdir home cd home mkdir user touch file.txt mkdir documents cd documents touch doc1.txt touch doc2.txt ls cd .. pwd ls Output doc1.txt doc2.txt /home documents file.txt user Note - The `ls` command lists the items in `documents` directory first as it is the current directory at the time the command is executed. - The `pwd` command prints `/home` showing that you are in the `home` directory after the `cd ..` command.","solution":"class FileSystem: def __init__(self): self.fs = {\'/\': {}} self.current_path = [\'/\'] def mkdir(self, dir_name): current_dict = self._get_current_dict() if dir_name not in current_dict: current_dict[dir_name] = {} def touch(self, file_name): current_dict = self._get_current_dict() if file_name not in current_dict: current_dict[file_name] = None def cd(self, dir_name): if dir_name == \'..\': if len(self.current_path) > 1: self.current_path.pop() else: current_dict = self._get_current_dict() if dir_name in current_dict and isinstance(current_dict[dir_name], dict): self.current_path.append(dir_name) def ls(self): current_dict = self._get_current_dict() items = sorted(current_dict.keys()) for item in items: print(item) def pwd(self): if len(self.current_path) == 1: print(\'/\') else: print(\'/\' + \'/\'.join(self.current_path[1:])) def _get_current_dict(self): current_dict = self.fs[\'/\'] for dir in self.current_path[1:]: current_dict = current_dict[dir] return current_dict def process_commands(commands): fs = FileSystem() for command in commands: parts = command.split() cmd = parts[0] if cmd == \'mkdir\': fs.mkdir(parts[1]) elif cmd == \'touch\': fs.touch(parts[1]) elif cmd == \'cd\': fs.cd(parts[1]) elif cmd == \'ls\': fs.ls() elif cmd == \'pwd\': fs.pwd()"},{"question":"A company is organizing a tournament where programmers will compete in solving coding challenges.

She\'s particularly interested in understanding how stable and unstable sorting algorithms behave. She decided to create a small experiment to differentiate between them. Alice has a list of n pairs of integers where each pair (xi, yi) contains a number xi and an index yi that is distinct and unique. She noticed when using a stable sort, pairs with equal first elements maintain their original relative order, while with an unstable sort, this might not happen. Alice applied an unstable sorting algorithm to her list of pairs based only on the first element of each pair. Now she wants to recover the original list of pairs before the sorting was applied using the current list and their indices. Help Alice by writing a code that restores the original list of pairs from the sorted list by using the indices. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of pairs. The next n lines contain two integers xi (−10^9 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9) and yi (1 ≤ yi ≤ n) — the pairs after the unstable sort has been applied, where xi is the value of the first element and yi is the unique index. Output Print n lines, each containing two integers xi and yi — the original list of pairs in their initial order before sorting.

For this challenge, each member needs to read at least one book from each of the five genres. The library, however, has a limited number of books for each genre, so it might be challenging to accommodate everyone\'s needs. Write a program that will determine whether it is possible to provide each member with the required books for the challenge. Input The first line of input contains five non-negative integers — the number of books available for each genre in the order: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi, and Biography.

The agency has several destinations, each represented as an integer point on a 2D grid. Trips are planned in straight lines between points and the cost of each trip is proportional to the Euclidean distance between points. However, the agency wants to minimize the total cost of the trips. The agency has noticed that it can save costs by arranging trips such that the path makes as many use of right-angle turns as possible. That is, rather than traveling directly between points, it prefers to travel to intermediate grid points, adding no additional cost since such turns use only taxi services which charge a flat fee independent of distance.

Each cell in the grid can either be empty, contain an obstacle, or contain an enemy with a health value. The player starts at the top-left corner, and their goal is to reach the bottom-right corner while reducing the health of enemies to zero by moving right or down. The player can only move to a cell if it is not an obstacle. If the cell contains an enemy, the player can reduce the enemy\'s health by the player\'s attack value. The player\'s attack value is initially 1 but can be increased by collecting power-ups. The objective is to determine if the player can reach the bottom-right corner and the minimum number of moves required to do so. Write a program to solve this problem.

Each stack has coins arranged in a cylindrical manner, which means the stacks have heights and some diameter. To test their problem-solving skills, participants are given a challenge to separate coins from each stack in specific ways following precise rules. Each participant is given a report card showing the number of coins and their initial configurations for each stack before the game starts. They must make their stacks appear exactly as depicted in the report card by adding or removing coins. Removing coins from the game is allowed, but coins cannot be added back once they are removed. Here are the rules for transforming the stacks: 1. You can remove coins from the top of any stack. 2. For each stack, you can only make it equal to or shorter than its original height as listed on the report card. 3. You must minimize the number of coin removals to match the stacks with the report card. The challenge is to determine the minimum number of coin removals required to achieve the configuration described in the report card.

Each character has a happiness level that changes based on ‘happy’ and ‘sad’ events, and certain events can amplify or dampen the impact of these changes. You are to implement a function that determines whether the character’s happiness level remains non-negative for the entire series of events. Let initial_happiness be the starting happiness level of the character. The character’s happiness level is affected by two types of events: - Happy event: increases happiness by happy_increment units. - Sad event: decreases happiness by sad_decrement units. At specific instances, there are modulation events which multiply the effect of happy events by happy_multiplier and sad events by sad_multiplier from that point onward. Given the initial happiness level, the increments and decrements for each event type, the multipliers for modulation events, and the series of events, determine if there exists any point where the character’s happiness level becomes negative. Write a function `def is_non_negative_happiness(events: List[Tuple[int, str]], initial_happiness: int, happy_increment: int, sad_decrement: int, happy_multiplier: int, sad_multiplier: int) -> bool:` where: - events: A list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: an integer representing the time of the event and a string representing the type of the event (\'happy\', \'sad\', or \'modulate\'). - initial_happiness: An integer representing the initial happiness level of the character. - happy_increment: An integer representing the happiness increment for \'happy\' events. - sad_decrement: An integer representing the happiness decrement for \'sad\' events. - happy_multiplier: An integer representing the multiplier for happy_increment when a \'modulate\' event occurs. - sad_multiplier: An integer representing the multiplier for sad_decrement when a \'modulate\' event occurs. The function should return a boolean indicating whether the happiness level never becomes negative. Here’s an example to illustrate: **Example 1:** Input: ``` events = [(1, \'happy\'), (2, \'modulate\'), (3, \'sad\'), (4, \'happy\'), (5, \'sad\')] initial_happiness = 5 happy_increment = 2 sad_decrement = 3 happy_multiplier = 3 sad_multiplier = 2 ``` Output: ``` True ``` Explanation: - At time 1, happiness increases by 2, making it 7. - At time 2, modulation occurs: happy_increment is now 6, sad_decrement is now 6. - At time 3, happiness decreases by 6, making it 1. - At time 4, happiness increases by 6, making it 7. - At time 5, happiness decreases by 6, making it 1.

The tree is rooted at node 1. Each node has a value associated with it. Your task is to find the sum of values of all nodes in the subtree of a given node. Input format: - The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. - The second line contains N integers where the i-th integer denotes the value assigned to the (i+1)-th node. - The next N-1 lines each contain two space-separated integers u and v denoting an undirected edge between node u and node v. - The last line contains an integer Q, the number of queries. - Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer x, representing the node whose subtree sum is to be calculated. Output format: For each query, print the sum of values of all nodes in the subtree of node x. Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ value of each node ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5 1 ≤ u, v, x ≤ N Note: - The input is given in the form of edges of the tree. - The output for each query should be in a new line.

Initially, the cards are arranged in sequence from 1 to `n`. Alice and Bob have a specific way to shuffle the deck, which involves repeatedly picking a subsequence of the cards and reversing it. Alice wants to know the minimum number of such operations needed to rearrange the cards such that for any card i, it should be followed by card i+1 in the sequence. Input The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), denoting the number of cards. Output For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to rearrange the deck of cards as described. Examples Input 2 4 5 Output 2 3 Note In the first sample, one possible way to rearrange the deck is: 1. Reverse the subsequence [2, 3, 4] to get [1, 4, 3, 2] 2. Reverse the subsequence [1, 4, 3, 2] to get [1, 2, 3, 4] In the second sample, one possible way to rearrange the deck is: 1. Reverse the subsequence [2, 3, 4, 5] to get [1, 5, 4, 3, 2] 2.
