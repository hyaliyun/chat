Each tree can increase or decrease its mana to maintain this balance. Your task is to determine the mana balance of every tree after a series of interactions, where in each interaction the mana of one tree is updated. Input The first line contains two integers M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000) and P (0 ≤ P ≤ 100,000), denoting the number of trees and the number of paths in the forest respectively. The next line contains M integers, where the ith integer denotes the initial mana value of the ith tree. The next P lines each contain two integers u and v, denoting a two-way path between tree u and tree v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ M; u ≠ v). The next line contains an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100,000), representing the number of interactions. The next K lines each contain two integers t and w, indicating the tree t whose mana is updated to w. Output Output M lines, each line containing an integer representing the final mana value of the ith tree after all interactions are performed.

Due to safety regulations, the supercollider cannot be constructed on any cell containing a building. The supercollider again has four accelerating chambers that form a plus sign when constructed.

One important aspect of their project is handling and manipulating version numbers of their neural network models. Version numbers follow a specific format, and the researchers need a tool that can compare different versions to determine which one is more recent. A version number is a string that is used to specify different releases of a software. A version number consists of one or more non-negative integers, separated by dots. For example, \\"1.0\\", \\"1.2.1\\", and \\"2.0\\" are all valid version numbers. Each component of a version number is called a \\"segment\\". The comparison rules for version numbers are as follows: 1. Compare the first segment of each version number. If one is greater than the other, the version with the greater segment is more recent. 2. If the first segments are equal, compare the second segments, and so on. 3. If the segments are of different lengths, the shorter version is considered to have missing trailing zeroes. For instance, version \\"1.0\\" is considered equal to \\"1.0.0\\". Your task is to write a program that can compare two version numbers and determine which one is more recent.

His goal is to design the layout so that each floor is generally accessible by moving only left and right between rooms. Alex has a budget that dictates the maximum number of floors he can build, but he wants to maximize the floor space usage of each floor. To simplify, let\'s consider each floor to be a sequence of rooms in a straight line. Furthermore, each room on a floor has a value that denotes its floor space usage score. Given an integer n, representing the maximum number of floors he can build and a 2D list (array of arrays) with integer values, where each array corresponds to a possible configuration of rooms for a floor, help Alex determine the floor configuration that maximizes the total floor space usage.

Instead of summing the digits in a straightforward manner, he believes in summing them until a single digit is obtained. To elaborate, given any positive integer, Bob repeatedly sums its digits until the result is a single digit. For example: - If Bob is given the number 9875, he would sum the digits as follows: - 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29 - 2 + 9 = 11 - 1 + 1 = 2 So, the single digit would be 2. - If Bob is given the number 49, he would sum the digits as follows: - 4 + 9 = 13 - 1 + 3 = 4 So, the single digit would be 4. Your task is to write a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns the single digit result according to Bob\'s method. Input: - A single positive integer, `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).

Each cell of the grid can be either an open space (represented by \'.\') or a wall (represented by \'#\'). Anna can move to any of the four adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) but cannot move diagonally. To reveal the hidden paths, Anna needs to use a sequence of magic numbers.

If an intersection is not reachable from the central intersection, the travel time to that intersection should be considered infinity. Input The first line contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) — the number of intersections and the number of roads, respectively. The next m lines each contain three integers u, v, and t (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; u ≠ v; 1 ≤ t ≤ 106), meaning there is a one-way road from intersection u to intersection v with a travel time of t. Output Output n integers. The first integer should be 0 (since the travel time from the central intersection to itself is zero), and the following n - 1 integers should represent the minimum travel times from the central intersection to the intersections 2 through n. If an intersection is not reachable, print \\"INF\\" for that intersection.

Your task is to implement a function to fetch data from the API. If the rate limit is exceeded, your function should return an error without making further API calls until the next minute begins.

The market consists of m sectors, each of which contains an array of stalls. Each sector i has exactly i stalls arranged in a semicircle. The sectors are numbered 1 through m in a clockwise fashion, and the stalls within each sector are numbered from 1 to the total number of stalls in that sector. Ashish works as a food vendor and has been given the task of distributing samples to every d-th stall starting from a specific stall (p, q), where p represents the sector number and q represents the stall number within that sector. He continues distributing in a clockwise manner moving between sectors circularly until he returns to the starting stall. For instance, if he starts at sector 1, stall 2 in a market with 3 sectors (where the number of stalls are 1, 2, and 3 respectively for each sector), and needs to distribute every 3rd stall, the distribution order will be (1,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) and so on, wrapping around to the beginning as necessary. However, Ashish has forgotten the value of d but remembers the number of stalls he needed to visit before he made his first full loop back to the start. Help Ashish determine the possible values of d and the minimum and maximum numbers of stalls he could have distributed the samples to before returning to the starting stall.

The game board consists of n slots, and each slot can hold an integer between 1 and m. The objective is to guess the correct sequence by asking queries about different subsets of the sequence. You are given the length of the sequence n and the range m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9). You can ask up to q (1 ≤ q ≤ 50) queries. In each query, you specify a non-empty subset of indices and the interactor will return the maximum value present in those indices for the secret sequence. The sequence does not change during the game. The sequence values are selected in such a way that the integers are unique and strictly increasing from left to right. Interaction To make a query, print a single line: ``` ? size index1 index2 ... index_size ``` where size is the number of indices in the subset you want to query about (1 ≤ size ≤ n), and index1, index2, ..., index_size are the indices of the subset (1 ≤ index ≤ n). For each query, you will receive an integer max — the maximum value in the secret sequence present at the queried indices. If your query is invalid (for instance, if you exceed the number of allowable queries or provide indices outside the allowable range), you will receive -1. When you have determined the sequence, print a single line: ``` ! value1 value2 ... value_n ``` where value1, value2, ..., value_n is the guessed secret sequence. If the guess is correct, you will receive the string \\"Correct\\", and you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If the guess is incorrect, you will receive the string \\"Incorrect\\", and you should terminate the program immediately.

Each bridge connects exactly two islands and has a certain fixed cost and fixed magical energy requirement to maintain it. The magical energy is supplied by a wizard, but his energy is limited. The wizard has only a certain amount of magical energy he is willing to use each month to keep the bridges up and running. The king of the magical land wants to ensure that all islands remain connected every month, but he also wants to minimize the cost of the bridges that remain active. Your task is to help the king determine the minimum cost needed to keep all islands connected without exceeding the wizard\'s magical energy capacity.

You need to perform the following steps iteratively until the array is fully sorted in non-decreasing order: 1. Find the first pair of consecutive elements `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `a[i] > a[i+1]`. 2. Swap `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`. Your task is to write a program that determines the number of swaps required to sort the array using the given procedure. # Input - The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the array. - The second line contains `n` unique positive integers `a[i]` (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10000) — the elements of the array. # Output - Print a single integer — the number of swaps required to sort the array using the given procedure. # Example Input ``` 5 4 3 2 1 5 ``` Output ``` 6 ``` # Note The initial array is `[4, 3, 2, 1, 5]`. - Swap `4` with `3`: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]` - Swap `4` with `2`: `[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]` - Swap `4` with `1`: `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]` - Swap `3` with `2`: `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` - Swap `3` with `1`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` - Swap `2` with `1`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` Total swaps required are 6.","solution":"def count_swaps_to_sort(n, a): Returns the number of swaps required to sort the array using the given procedure. swaps = 0 sorted_flag = False while not sorted_flag: sorted_flag = True for i in range(n - 1): if a[i] > a[i + 1]: # Swap the elements a[i], a[i + 1] = a[i + 1], a[i] swaps += 1 sorted_flag = False return swaps"},{"question":"Alice is organizing a marathon event in her city. She wants to track the positions of all participants over time to determine their current rankings during the race. The marathon route consists of N checkpoints, each with a unique number from 1 to N. However, instead of just asking for the rankings based on a single point in time, she has planned several queries to understand the progress of different runners. Each query consists of a pair (si, ei) representing a span between two checkpoints (inclusive), and Alice wants to know the total number of unique runners who have been at any checkpoint in that span. Below is a detailed explanation of the requirements: Input: - The first line of input is the number of test cases T (1 <= T <= 10). - For each test case, the first line contains two integers N (1 <= N <= 100) and M (1 <= M <= 100), where N is the number of checkpoints and M is the number of participants. - The next M lines each contain a sequence of N integers.

The grid is represented as an `M x N` matrix where each cell contains either a token represented by `1` or is empty represented by `0`. Players can only collect tokens if they follow a specific sequence of moves given as a string consisting of `U` (up), `D` (down), `L` (left), and `R` (right) commands. Each move command refers to moving from one cell to an adjacent cell in the specified direction. Let us assume the grid is zero-indexed and the player starts from the top-left corner of the grid `(0,0)`. The player will follow the sequence of moves and collect tokens as they encounter them. The game must record the total number of tokens collected after following the sequence of moves.

The system should support the creation of several items, track their quantities, and allow for updates to the quantity when items are sold or restocked. Each item will have a unique identifier, a name, and a quantity. You will write a program that processes a series of instructions to manage the inventory. Input: The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of instructions. Each of the next n lines contains one instruction. The possible instructions are described below. Instructions: 1. \\"Create [id] [name] [quantity]\\" — Create a new item with the given unique identifier [id], name [name], and an initial quantity [quantity]. All identifiers are unique and consist of lowercase Latin letters, having lengths from 1 to 10 characters inclusive. Names consist of lowercase Latin letters and have lengths from 1 to 50 characters inclusive. Quantities are integers from 0 to 1000 inclusive. 2. \\"Sell [id] [quantity]\\" — Decrease the quantity of the item with the given [id] by [quantity]. If the new quantity would be negative, the item\'s quantity should be set to 0. 3. \\"Restock [id] [quantity]\\" — Increase the quantity of the item with the given [id] by [quantity]. 4. \\"List\\" — Output the current inventory. For each item, output its id, name, and quantity on a new line, sorted lexicographically by id. Output: After processing all instructions, the program should output the current inventory as described in the \\"List\\" instruction. If the \\"List\\" instruction appears multiple times, output the inventory state at that point.

He recently came across a peculiar sequence transformation called \\"Xorfy Transform\\". Given a sequence of integers, the Xorfy Transform of the sequence is generated by performing the following steps: 1. Take the binary representation of each integer in the sequence. 2. For each bit position (starting from the least significant bit), compute the XOR of the bits at that position across all integers in the sequence. 3. Construct a new sequence where each element is the integer formed by the XOR results at each bit position. For example, given a sequence [5, 9], the binary representations are: - 5: 0101 - 9: 1001 The XOR results for each bit position are: - bit 0: 1 (since 1 XOR 1 = 0) - bit 1: 0 (since 0 XOR 0 = 0) - bit 2: 1 (since 1 XOR 0 = 1) - bit 3: 1 (since 0 XOR 1 = 1) So, the result of the Xorfy Transform would be [10] (since 1010 in binary is 10 in decimal).
