The branch is represented by values: param1, param2. The param1, param2 can be one of these: 'int', '.guard', 'func'. The 'guard' is an expression which always evaluates to True or False and is used to control the flow of the program. 'func' is a name of some function. Both 'guard' and 'func' don't have any arguments. Let's write code generator. This code will output 'guard' expression, function call of 'func' and simple 'int' assignment. I hope this explanation is understandable. Here is example: Branch: ('int', .guard) Code: x = 5 if cond: pass Here 'cond' is the actual value of .guard (which is some boolean expression) Other example: Branch: ('int', 'func') Code: x = 5 func() Branch: ('guard', 'int') Code: if cond: x = 6 Here 'cond' is the actual value of 'guard' Branch: ('guard', 'func') Code: if cond: func() Here 'guard' is some expression evaluating to True/False and func is a name of the function.

It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack.

If either condition is true, it returns False. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty.

To place all these chemical containers in exact spots, an algorithm is used. This algorithm for 'n' number of cylinders, pails, and crates consists of the following steps: 1. Place the first cylinder in the first spot. 2. Place the 'n+1-th' pail just after the 'n-th' cylinder. 3. Place the 'n+1-th' crate behind the 'n-th' pail (always). Step 3 is repeated for new cylinder locations. If n = 5, for instance, place the sixth pail after the fifth cylinder, the seventh crate after the sixth pail, the eight cylinder after the seventh crate, the ninth pail, and tenth crate, following the same pattern. Let's say you have an empty list of items where the items in the position will be stored. Initialize the list to carry out the 20th iteration.

To overcome the issue of this, we should modify the algorithm such that after every three items (i.e., 'cylinder', 'pail' and 'crate') one 'cylinder' is added.

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each node is the child of the previous node in the sequence. For this problem, we can move either left or right child from parent node. Path sum is the sum of all node's value in the path. Here's an example tree for your reference: 2 / -1 3 In this tree, there are three paths: - Path 1: 2 -> -1 - Path 2: 2 -> 3 - Path 2: We don't have any path like this with more than two node in the given tree The maximum path sum is 2 -> 3 which has a sum of 5. Now, let's consider another tree -10 / 9 20 / 15 7 There are five paths: - Path 1: -10 -> 9 - Path 2: -10 -> 20 -> 15 - Path 3: -10 -> 20 -> 7 - Path 4: We don't have any path like this with more than three nodes in the given tree - Path 5: We don't have any path like this with more than two nodes in the given tree The maximum path sum is -10 -> 20 -> 15 which has a sum of 25.

The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The process can be described as a traversal of the graph depthward motion, where the leftmost branch at each node is fully traversed before moving rightward. \`\`\`python def DFS(graph, start): visited, stack = set(), [start] while stack: vertex = stack.pop() if vertex not in visited: print(vertex) visited.add(vertex) stack.extend(graph[vertex] - visited) return visited # Driver code if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # Testing DFS graph = {'A': {'B', 'C'}, 'B': {'A', 'D', 'E'}, 'C': {'A', 'F'}, 'D': {'B'}, 'E': {'B', 'F'}, 'F': {'C', 'E'}} print(\\"Following is Depth First Traversal: \\") visited = DFS(graph, 'A') # returns the visited nodes when calling DFS on a graph starting from \`A\` print(\\"All nodes which were visited:\\", visited) \`\`\` **Step 1:** Find the **time complexity** of a Depth-First Search using its pseudocode, given that each vertex might have \`m\` neighbors and any two distinct vertices might be connected by an edge, in the worst-case scenario.

Example: 19 is a happy number: 12 + 92 = 82 82 -> 64 + 22 = 68 68 -> 62 + 82 = 100 100 -> 12 + 02 + 02 = 4 4 -> 16 = 1 Challenge: Write a function to determine whether a number is a happy number or not. Constraints: - The input (n) will always be a non-negative integer. Code \`\`\`python def is_happy_number(n): seen = set() while n != 1 and n not in seen: seen.add(n) n = sum(int(i) ** 2 for i in str(n)) return n == 1 \`\`\` Explanation The provided code defines a function \`is_happy_number(n)\` that checks if a given non-negative integer \`n\` is a happy number. Here is how it works: 1. We use a \`set\` named \`seen\` to keep track of numbers we've encountered before to detect cycles. 2. We enter a loop that continues as long as \`n\` is not 1 (which would indicate it's a happy number) and \`n\` is not in the \`seen\` set (which would indicate a cycle). 3. Inside the loop, we add the current \`n\` to the \`seen\` set. 4. Then, we update \`n\` to be the sum of the squares of its digits. This is achieved by converting \`n\` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back to an integer, squaring it, and summing all these squared digits. 5. Once the loop ends, we check if \`n\` is 1. If it is, we return \`True\`, indicating \`n\` is a happy number. If \`n\` is not 1, it means we've entered a cycle, so we return \`False\`, indicating \`n\` is not a happy number. However, I want to write it in another way. Here is how I can improve it: \`\`\`python def is_happy_number(num): def get_digits_sum(n): return sum(int(i) ** 2 for i in str(n)) seen = set() while num != 1 and num not in seen: seen.add(num) num = get_digits_sum(num) return num == 1 \`\`\` Tests and Example Uses \`\`\`python print(is_happy_number(19)) # True print(is_happy_number(20)) # False \`\`\` In your opinion, what is the most Pythonic way to write this code.

Repeated File Intake: Each time a file is uploaded, we start with a clean, empty list that only stores file names of the uploaded files. 2. No File Selected: if no file is selected from the dialog box, do not add anything to the file names list. 3. Duplicate File Handling: If the same file is uploaded multiple times (which should rarely occur), we append (1), (2), etc. after the file name. 4. Single File Upload: The control should support uploading a single file. 5. Multiple File Upload: The control should support uploading multiple files at once. 6. File Name Display: The uploaded file names should be visible in a text area. 7. File Upload Event Handling: When files are uploaded - we want to capture the file upload event to perform additional functionality - e.g., start a timer etc. Now we are updating the file upload feature in our application to support these additional features: 8. Preset Folder Support: previously we allowed users to select files only. now we want to enable the users to upload an entire folder. 9.ASYNC Upload: Allow for asynchronous upload of files 10. Validate Files Before Upload: we want to enable whitelisting and blacklisting of certain file types before the upload begins. 11. Regular Upload is Still Supported: users should still be able to upload individual files. With the existing and new specifications, what changes would I need to make to our current file upload control? To achieve the new specifications: - The user interface of the control needs to be modified to allow the user to select either a file or a folder. - You need to handle folder upload logic (add folder name, iterate through files and handle file uploads). - Modify existing file handling code to accommodate new file types validation, which involves checking file extension and storing it so that once the entire folder is uploaded, it can trigger the next step in the process. - Add error handling to notify users that certain file types are not allowed. - Implement asynchronous upload using some sort of queueing system such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka or azure storage queue and ensure that upload process is fault-tolerant - Update file handling event to perform custom actions (like triggering a timer) once the file is uploaded. Please consider these questions: - What kind of changes are needed in the existing code to support these new requirements? - Are we required to introduce new infrastructure components (like a database, message broker) to support these new requirements? - Would the whitelisting and blacklisting logic be a part of the UI or the backend (i.e., server-side)? Based on the detailed explanation I provided, please provide some code and design insights as to how the changes could be achieved.","solution":"import os from typing import List, Dict class FileUploadControl: def __init__(self): self.file_names = [] self.allowed_file_types = set() self.blocked_file_types = set() self.file_count = {} def upload_files(self, files: List[str], is_async: bool = False): Upload files method which accepts either single or multiple files. if not files: return self.file_names = [] self.file_count = {} if is_async: self._async_upload(files) else: self._regular_upload(files) def _regular_upload(self, files: List[str]): for file in files: if os.path.isdir(file): self._handle_folder_upload(file) else: self._handle_file_upload(file) def _async_upload(self, files: List[str]): # Here is where you can implement the asynchronous upload logic using # a message broker or a queueing system like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, etc. # Example implementation can vary based on the chosen system. queue = [] queue.extend(files) while queue: curr_file = queue.pop(0) if os.path.isdir(curr_file): folder_files = [os.path.join(curr_file, f) for f in os.listdir(curr_file)] queue.extend(folder_files) else: self._handle_file_upload(curr_file, process_async=True) def _handle_folder_upload(self, folder: str): Handle uploading of folder by iterating through its files and processing them. for root, _, files in os.walk(folder): for file in files: self._handle_file_upload(os.path.join(root, file)) def _handle_file_upload(self, file: str, process_async: bool = False): Handle single file upload, ensuring duplication management, and validation against whitelisted and blacklisted file types. extension = os.path.splitext(file)[1].lower() if extension in self.blocked_file_types or (self.allowed_file_types and extension not in self.allowed_file_types): print(f\\"Skipping file {file}: File type not allowed.\\") return file_name = os.path.basename(file) if file_name in self.file_count: self.file_count[file_name] += 1 file_name = f\\"{os.path.splitext(file_name)[0]}({self.file_count[file_name]}){extension}\\" else: self.file_count[file_name] = 0 self.file_names.append(file_name) if not process_async: self._perform_upload_event() def set_allowed_file_types(self, file_types: List[str]): self.allowed_file_types = {ext.lower() for ext in file_types} def set_blocked_file_types(self, file_types: List[str]): self.blocked_file_types = {ext.lower() for ext in file_types} def _perform_upload_event(self): Perform any additional actions or event handling after a file is uploaded.

If the numbers are in the wrong order (the larger number comes first), then swap them. Keep doing this with every pair, over and over, until no more swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted. Here is a general outline of how the algorithm should be implemented: * We should have a function that takes a list of numbers as input. * The function should repeatedly go through the list, comparing adjacent numbers and swapping them if necessary, until the list is sorted. * We can use a boolean flag to track whether any swaps were made in a pass through the list.

This allows for more efficient and robust parsing. * **Input/Output:** The \`count_keyword_occurrences\` function now takes two parameters, \`url\` and \`keyword\`, making it reusable.

Explanation: A bridge in a graph is an edge which, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph. To find all bridges in the given graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Algorithm To find all bridges in the given graph, we can use the following steps: 1. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited vertices. 2. Initialize a discovery array to store the discovery time of each vertex. 3. Initialize a low-value array to store the lowest reachable ancestor of each vertex. 4. Perform DFS traversal of the graph and update the low-value array. 5. Check if the current edge is a bridge or not. If it is, then add it to the list of bridges.

Here is the step-by-step analysis: - Create a deck of 52 cards. - Deal 2 cards to the player. - Deal 2 cards to the dealer. - Calculate the total value of the player's hand and the dealer's hand using the standard Blackjack rules (number cards are worth their face value, Jack/Queen/King are worth 10 points, Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points). - If the player's total value exceeds 21, they immediately lose the game. - If the player's total value is less than or equal to 21, they can choose to either hit (take another card) or stay (keep their current hand). - If the player chooses to hit, deal them another card and recalculate their total value. - If the player's total value exceeds 21 after hitting, they immediately lose the game. - If the player chooses to stay, the dealer reveals their hand and follows a set of predetermined rules: - If the dealer's total value is less than 17, they must draw another card. - If the dealer's total value is 17 or more, they must stay. - If the dealer's total value exceeds 21, the player wins the game. - If both the player and the dealer have a total value of 21 or less, the highest total value wins the game.

You can navigate from one room to another room by first pressing a direction button in the current room and then visiting the next room in that direction. For example, if we are in room A and we press \`East\` button in room A and the room to the east is B, then we can visit room B. Given a label of the room where our journey starts and an array of room labels of the path taken to reach the target room, find the minimum number of button presses required to reach the target room from the start room.\\" Let's break down the plan of how to approach this problem: 1. **Understand the Problem**: - **Goal**: To calculate the minimum number of button presses required to reach a target room from a start room. - **Input Parameters**: - \`n\`: The total number of rooms in the haunted house. - \`start\`: The label of the room where the journey starts. - \`path\`: An array of room labels representing the path taken to reach the target room. 2. **auxiliary information**: Each room is connected to up to four rooms (North, South, East, West). We need to figure out which rooms are connected in which directions. For the sake of the problem, let's assume that the room connections are known. 3. **Example Analysis**: - For example, if the \`start\` room is \`A\` and the \`path\` is \`[A, B, C]\`, we need to know the connections between \`A\` and \`B\`, and \`B\` and \`C\` to determine how many times we need to press the buttons. Now that we have a clearer understanding of the problem, let's proceed to devise a solution strategy. To come up with a solution, we also need to know the layout of the rooms. For the sake of this example, let's assume the layout is a grid where each room is represented by a coordinate \`(x, y)\`. Here is the updated problem description with known room connections: \\"Given \`n\`, \`start\`, \`path\`, and the connections between rooms (which can be represented by a grid or adjacency list or any other data structure suitable for the problem), calculate the minimum number of button presses required to reach a target room from a start room. Assume each room is in a grid and we can navigate up, down, left, or right to an adjacent room. Let's represent each room by its coordinates (x, y) and the room connections using an adjacency list. For example, \`rooms = [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]\`, and the start room is \`(0,0)\` and the path is \`[(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)]\`. The \`path\` list shows the path taken to reach the target room. However, the minimum number of button presses is needed. To find the minimum number of button presses, we can iterate through each room in the \`path\` and determine the direction we need to press to reach the next room. Here is some sample Python code for the problem: \`\`\`python def min_button_presses(n, start, path, rooms): Calculate the minimum number of button presses required to reach a target room from a start room.

It can handle negative weight edges and can detect negative cycles. Implementation Details The following code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm in Python: \`\`\`python class Graph: def __init__(self, vertices): self.V = vertices self.graph = [] def add_edge(self, u, v, w): self.graph.append([u, v, w]) def bellman_ford(self, src): dist = [float(\\"Inf\\")] * self.V dist[src] = 0 for _ in range(self.V - 1): for u, v, w in self.graph: if dist[u] != float(\\"Inf\\") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]: dist[v] = dist[u] + w for u, v, w in self.graph: if dist[u] != float(\\"Inf\\") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]: print(\\"Graph contains a negative-weight cycle\\") return print(\\"Vertex Distance from Source\\") for i in range(self.V): print(f\\"{i} tt {dist[i]}\\") # Example usage g = Graph(5) g.add_edge(0, 1, -1) g.add_edge(0, 2, 4) g.add_edge(1, 2, 3) g.add_edge(1, 3, 2) g.add_edge(1, 4, 2) g.add_edge(3, 2, 5) g.add_edge(3, 1, 1) g.add_edge(4, 3, -3) g.bellman_ford(0) \`\`\` Explanation * We initialize the distance array \`dist\` with infinite values for all vertices except the source vertex, which is set to 0. * We relax the edges repeatedly. In each iteration, we check if the distance to the source vertex \`u\` plus the weight of the edge from \`u\` to \`v\` is less than the current distance to \`v\`. If it is, we update the distance to \`v\`. * After relaxing the edges \`V-1\` times, where \`V\` is the number of vertices, we check for negative-weight cycles by iterating over the edges one more time. If we can still relax any edge, then there is a negative cycle in the graph. Time Complexity * The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(V * E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Example Use Cases * The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used in various scenarios such as: * **Finding the shortest path in a graph with negative weight edges**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative weight edges, making it suitable for graphs where the cost of traversing an edge can be negative. * **Detecting negative cycles**: The algorithm can detect negative cycles in a graph, which is useful in scenarios where the presence of a negative cycle would indicate an inconsistency or an error in the graph.

This means that the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first. 2. **Stack Operations**: The basic operations that can be performed on a stack are: - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack. - **Pop**: Removes an element from the top of the stack. - **Peek**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it. - **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty. - **size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack. Step-by-step solution: 3. **Choosing a Data Structure**: We can implement a stack using an array or a linked list. For simplicity, we'll use an array. 4. **Initializing the Stack**: Initialize an empty array with a specified size and a variable to keep track of the top element. 5. **Implementing Push Operation**: If the stack is not full, add the element to the top and increment the top pointer. 6. **Implementing Pop Operation**: If the stack is not empty, remove the top element and decrement the top pointer. 7. **Implementing Peek Operation**: If the stack is not empty, return the top element. 8. **Implementing isEmpty Operation**: Check if the top pointer is -1 (indicating an empty stack). 9. **Implementing size Operation**: Return the current index of the top pointer plus one.

The catch: the function must use the built-in sort method, and the function must execute in linear time (ie the function cannot use a general-purpose sorting algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n log n)). Sounds simple, but this problem actually requires some care. This answer is a bit tricky, because the built-in sort function in most languages is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, meaning that it has a time complexity of O(n log n). But we can get around this by taking advantage of the fact that we're squaring numbers. The key insight is this: when we square a negative number, it becomes positive. This means that if we have a list of integers, sorting the list first will allow us to identify the point at which the numbers go from negative to positive. Here's how we can solve this problem: First, sort the input list in-place (meaning that we modify the original list) using the built-in sort method. This has a time complexity of O(n log n), but this is okay because we're doing it only once. Next, initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the list and one at the end of the list. Let's call them \`left\` and \`right\`. Then, initialize an empty list to hold our result. Next, while \`left\` is less than or equal to \`right\`, we do the following: 1. Square the values at the \`left\` and \`right\` indices. 2. Compare the two squared values. 3. If the squared value at \`left\` is less than the squared value at \`right\`, add the squared value at \`left\` to our result list and increment \`left\`. 4. Otherwise, add the squared value at \`right\` to our result list and decrement \`right\`. By doing this, we're effectively sorting the squared values without having to use a comparison-based sorting algorithm. This is because we're taking advantage of the fact that we've already sorted the original list. This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the initial sort, and then O(n) for the two-pointer technique, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n). But here's the rub: the problem statement says that the function must execute in linear time, which means that our current approach won't work. However, there are some cases where we can achieve linear time complexity. If the input list contains only non-negative numbers, we can simply square each number and return the list, since the list will already be sorted. Similarly, if the input list contains only non-positive numbers, we can square each number, reverse the list, and return it, since the list will already be sorted in descending order. We can take advantage of these properties to achieve linear time complexity in certain cases. Here is a Python solution that implements this approach: \`\`\`python def sort_squared(nums): Given a list of integers, returns a new sorted list containing the squares of each integer in the input list. The function first checks if the input list contains only non-negative or non-positive numbers. If it does, the function squares each number and returns the list (or the reversed list) in linear time. Otherwise, the function uses a two-pointer technique to sort the squared numbers in linear time. Time complexity: O(n log n) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case.","solution":"def sort_squared(nums): Given a list of integers, returns a new sorted list containing the squares of each integer in the input list.

I am writing software targeted for an older machine (low memory). I can't use many algorithms due to resource limitations. I need to simply sort an array (of unique values) so that the number of inversions are minimized. Note that an inversion in an array is a pair of elements, where the first element is greater than the second, regardless of the positions of other elements. If we have an array with several values where an element is larger than some of the elements after it, there are multiple inversions for that given element. Can we use a simple technique to minimize the total number of inversions? Yes, of course. One simple one I learned is just sorting the array. But there are some algorithms that take more memory or more computational power than available. However, there are even simpler techniques that will get a \\"good\\" result but don't require much computational power or additional memory. Here is one simple technique: - start with the first element of the array and call it the \\"current value\\". - Then, with each of the remaining values, the process can check: \\"If I were to insert this new value before the current one, how many new inversions would I introduce, and how many would I eliminate.\\" For example: in the array of {5, 2, 8, 6, 1}, the first 5 has no \\"inversions\\" that can be eliminated by moving values before it because there are no values before it to check. However, when we get to the second value, \\"2\\", we must evaluate inserting it as the first element. This insertion would eliminate zero inversions but would introduce zero new inversions, since there were no values before it to start with. With 5 being larger than 2, moving 2 before the first element does in fact both introduce a new inversion for each of the elements after the value 2 that are smaller than 2 (none in this case) and would eliminate an inversion (in this case between 5 and 2). So the process to insert 2 before 5 is like this: Original array [5, 2, 8, 6, 1]. Insertion in array before first value is [2, 5, 8, 6, 1]. There are no new inversions made between the element 2 and the elements to the right of it in the new array (and there were no elements to its left). However, we did eliminate one inversion. We do this process for each value in the rest of the array and we end up with a very good solution, one where there are minimal inversions for a conceptually simple algorithm and that requires the least amount of computational power and memory. That said, here is the problem. Write code that implements this inversion minimization technique and illustrate its usage using a few different cases of input to show that the \\"final resulting array\\" after this technique minimizes inversions quite well considering it is simple. I - So here is the question: Write the algorithm that implements the described technique (code and a good set of example usage) to minimize inversions. II - Next question: Is this algorithm linear (meaning that its performance declines linearly as the input grows) in terms of worst-case computational complexity.
