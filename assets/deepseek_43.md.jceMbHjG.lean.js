Each node in the system is represented as a unique integer from 1 to N. Sarah\'s task is to implement a function to check if it\'s possible to send a message from one node to another by following a series of bidirectional connections between the nodes. Two nodes are directly connected if there is a bidirectional connection between them. Sarah also needs to ensure that there are no cycles in the network after adding a new connection, meaning that the network should remain cycle-free which effectively makes it a tree-like structure. Your task is to help Sarah by implementing two functions: 1. `add_connection(a, b)`: This function creates a bidirectional connection between nodes `a` and `b`. If adding this connection would create a cycle, the function should return \\"Cycle detected\\" and not add the connection. Otherwise, it should add the connection and return \\"Connection added\\". 2. `can_send_message(start, end)`: This function returns \\"Yes\\" if it\'s possible to send a message from the node `start` to the node `end`, and \\"No\\" otherwise. The program will read initially the number of nodes `N` and a series of instructions either to add a new connection or to check if a message can be sent. Input: - The first line contains an integer `N` denoting the number of nodes in the system. - The next lines contain commands, each on a new line in the format: - `ADD a b` - This command tries to create a bidirectional connection between node `a` and node `b`. - `CHECK start end` - This command checks if a message can be sent from node `start` to node `end`. Output: - For each `ADD` command, print either \\"Connection added\\" or \\"Cycle detected\\". - For each `CHECK` command, print either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\".

It’s possible now to send a message between 2 and 3 through node 1. - Adding a connection between nodes 3 and 4 and then checking the connection between 2 and 5 returns \\"No\\" because node 5 isn\'t connected yet. - Adding the connection between 2 and 4 would create a cycle, so \\"Cycle detected\\" is returned. - Finally, adding a connection between 4 and 5 and checking the connection from 2 to 5 returns \\"Yes\\" indicating the message can be passed.","solution":"class DisjointSet: def __init__(self, n): self.parent = list(range(n + 1)) self.rank = [0] * (n + 1) def find(self, u): if self.parent[u] != u: self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u]) # Path compression return self.parent[u] def union(self, u, v): root_u = self.find(u) root_v = self.find(v) # If they are already in the same set, they will form a cycle if root_u == root_v: return False # Union by rank if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]: self.parent[root_v] = root_u elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]: self.parent[root_u] = root_v else: self.parent[root_v] = root_u self.rank[root_u] += 1 return True class Network: def __init__(self, n): self.n = n self.dsu = DisjointSet(n) def add_connection(self, a, b): if self.dsu.union(a, b): return \\"Connection added\\" else: return \\"Cycle detected\\" def can_send_message(self, start, end): if self.dsu.find(start) == self.dsu.find(end): return \\"Yes\\" else: return \\"No\\" # Helper function to process commands def process_commands(queries): n = int(queries[0]) network = Network(n) results = [] for query in queries[1:]: parts = query.split() command = parts[0] if command == \\"ADD\\": a, b = int(parts[1]), int(parts[2]) result = network.add_connection(a, b) elif command == \\"CHECK\\": start, end = int(parts[1]), int(parts[2]) result = network.can_send_message(start, end) results.append(result) return results"},{"question":"Penguin Travel Agency wants to develop an application that simulates the food supply strategy for penguins in Antarctic expeditions.

Each penguin has a preference list that ranks in descending order the food packages they prefer from each station based on coordinates. The closer the food supply station to the penguin, the higher the preference. If two stations are equidistant, the station with the lexicographically smaller coordinate is preferred. Write a program that reads data about the food stations and the penguins\' preferences and then outputs the food package distribution from each station that maximizes each penguin’s satisfaction based on their preferences. If a preferred package is unavailable from a preferred station, the program should allocate the next best package based on the given preferences.

Input The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), where n is the number of warehouses, and c is the truck\'s carrying capacity. The second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn (0 ≤ pi ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n), where pi represents the number of packages at the i-th warehouse. Output Print a single integer, the minimum total delivery time required to deliver all packages. Example Input 3 3 3 3 3 Output 6 Note In the example above, there are three warehouses and the truck can carry 3 packages at a time. The optimal way to deliver packages would be: 1. Deliver 3 packages to the first warehouse in 1 unit time. 2. Return to the hub and deliver the remaining 3 packages to the second warehouse in 1 unit time. 3.

They keep taking turns until no palindromic substring remains in the string. The player who makes the last move wins.

Part of this encryption process requires generating a series of unique keys from a given initial set. The algorithm to generate these keys is defined as follows: 1.

To generate the i-th key in the series, use the formula: ``` key_i = key_{i-1} XOR val_i ``` where `val_i` is a fixed integer provided initially for the i-th key in the series. Given an array `vals` of size `N`, your task is to generate and return the series of keys of the same length.

Given a list of planets and trade routes, help the Association by determining if the provided graph is connected. A graph is connected if there is a path between any pair of nodes. Input The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10000) — the number of planets (nodes) and the number of trade routes (edges), respectively. The next m lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) — representing a trade route between planet u and planet v. Output Print \\"YES\\" if the galaxy is connected, and \\"NO\\" otherwise.

Input The first line contains two integers m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) and D (1 ≤ D ≤ 1000) — the number of tasks and the difficulty threshold, respectively. Each of the next m lines contains two integers pi and di (1 ≤ pi, di ≤ 100) — the number of points the i-th task gives and its difficulty level. Output Print a single integer — the maximum number of points an employee can accumulate without exceeding the difficulty threshold D.

There are 3 tasks with their respective points and difficulty levels: - Task 1: 10 points, 20 difficulty - Task 2: 20 points, 30 difficulty - Task 3: 30 points, 50 difficulty The difficulty threshold is 50. The employee can solve either task 1 and task 2 (total points 10 + 20 = 30), or just task 3 (30 points). Therefore, the maximum is 30 points. In the second sample, there are 4 tasks, and the difficulty threshold is 100. The employee can solve the first three tasks for a total of 20 + 30 + 50 = 100 points without exceeding the difficulty threshold.","solution":"def max_points(m, D, tasks): dp = [[0] * (D + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)] for i in range(1, m + 1): points, difficulty = tasks[i - 1] for j in range(D + 1): dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] if j >= difficulty: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - difficulty] + points) return dp[m][D]"},{"question":"Write a program to find the common elements in two lists of integers.

A hacker managed to gain access to one of the computers and is attempting to spread a virus throughout the network. The virus can only spread through direct connections, and each infected computer will, in the next second, infect all directly connected computers.

In this problem, you will create a system to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. The graph is represented by nodes and edges where each edge has a non-negative weight.

If there is already an edge between these nodes, update its weight to the new weight `w`. 2. `shortest_path(s, t)`: This operation returns the length of the shortest path from node `s` to node `t`. If there is no path between `s` and `t`, return -1. **Constraints:** - The number of nodes `n` in the graph is at most 100,000. - The number of edges `m` in the graph is at most 200,000. - The weights `w` of the edges are non-negative integers and do not exceed 1,000,000. - Node IDs `u` and `v` are integers ranging from 1 to `n`. **Input:** The first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, the number of nodes and edges, respectively. The next `m` lines contain three integers each, `u`, `v`, and `w`, representing an edge with weight `w` between nodes `u` and `v`.

The database contains multiple tables, each table consisting of multiple rows and columns. You need to write a program to handle the \\"SELECT\\" queries over the tables. The \\"SELECT\\" query supports retrieving specific columns or all columns from a table. A typical \\"SELECT\\" query in your database engine has two forms: 1. `SELECT * FROM table_name` - Selects all columns from the table named `table_name`. 2. `SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN FROM table_name` - Selects specific columns from the table named `table_name`. The following rules apply: - Column names and table names consist of lowercase English letters and numbers with lengths of not more than 20 characters. - You can assume that all column names in a table are unique, but tables may have varying schemas (i.e., different columns). - The order of columns in the output should be the same as they appear in the table definition. Input - The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of tables. - The descriptions of the tables follow. Each table description starts with a line containing the table name and an integer `c` (1 ≤ c ≤ 20), the number of columns in this table. - The next line contains the column names separated by spaces. - The following line contains an integer `r` (1 ≤ r ≤ 100) — the number of rows in this table. - Each of the next `r` lines contains the values for each row separated by spaces. - The next line contains a single integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 100) — the number of queries. - The next `q` lines each contain one query in one of the two forms mentioned above. Output - For each query, output the result of the query. If the query is valid, print the rows of the result set.

Let’s dive into one such intriguing puzzle! The puzzle involves determining if it’s possible to transform an initial array into a target array through specific permutations. The initial and target arrays are both composed of integers, and a permutation consists of choosing any two indices and swapping the elements at the chosen indices. The challenge is to decide whether one can transform the initial array into the target array by applying zero or more permutations. Consider the given example below for better understanding: Example: Initial array: [1, 3, 2, 4] Target array: [2, 1, 4, 3] It’s clear that the numbers in the target array are just re-ordered versions of numbers in the initial array, meaning they can be made identical via some permutations. Input The input consists of a single test case in the following format: `n` `a1 a2 a3 ... an` `b1 b2 b3 ... bn` Where: - `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is the length of both arrays. - `a1 a2 a3 ... an` are the elements of the initial array of integers. - `b1 b2 b3 ... bn` are the elements of the target array of integers.

However, due to the complex nature of magic, performing a spell costs an amount of energy equal to the difference in their positions. For example, swapping the plant at position 1 with the plant at position 4 costs |1 - 4| = 3 energy units. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of energy required to make the arrangement of plants palindromic. Input The first line contains an integer n representing the number of plants (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The second line contains n integers where the i-th integer represents the magical power of the i-th plant (1 ≤ power ≤ 1000). Output Output a single integer which is the minimum energy required to make the plant arrangement palindromic. Examples Input 4 1 3 2 1 Output 1 Input 3 1 2 1 Output 0 Input 5 1 5 3 1 5 Output 4 Explanation In the first example, swapping the plant at position 2 with the plant at position 3 creates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 1], which is a palindrome with a cost of 1 unit of energy. In the second example, the sequence is already palindromic, so the cost is 0. In the third example, swapping the plant at position 2 with the plant at position 5 results in the sequence [1, 1, 3, 1, 5] and swapping the plant at position 3 with the plant at position 4 results in the sequence [1, 5, 3, 1, 5], forming a palindrome with a total cost of 4 units of energy (3 + 1).","solution":"def min_energy_to_palindrome(n, powers): Calculate the minimum energy required to make the arrangement of plants palindromic.

You need to implement two operations: 1. **Update the quantity** of an item in a specific warehouse. 2. **Query the total quantity** of an item across all warehouses. **Input:** The input consists of multiple operations provided in a set of instructions. Each set starts with an integer `O` (1 ≤ O ≤ 100), the number of operations. Each of the next `O` lines contains an operation in one of the following two formats: - \\"Update warehouse_id item_id quantity\\" — Updates the quantity of the `item_id` in the `warehouse_id` to the given `quantity`. If the warehouse and item do not exist, they will be created with the given quantity. - \\"Query item_id\\" — Queries the total quantity of the `item_id` across all warehouses. The `warehouse_id` and `item_id` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ warehouse_id, item_id ≤ 1000), and `quantity` is an integer (0 ≤ quantity ≤ 10000). **Output:** For each \\"Query\\" operation, print the total quantity of the specified `item_id` across all warehouses.

Each node in the tree represents an ant, and each ant has a certain amount of food stored in it. The root ant (the ant at the top of the tree) holds the total food collected in the colony. Each ant, starting from the leaves up to the root, needs to contribute all of its food to its direct parent ant in the tree structure. The amount of food an ant contributes is the food stored at its node. Your task is to determine the distribution of food at each level of the binary tree, from the root down to the leaves.

Example: Input: 3 10 4 6 3 1 5 2 Output: 31 10 7 Explanation: - At level 1 (the root), we have the initial food amount collected in the colony which is 31 (the root ant received all food contributions). - At level 2, the root ant distributes its total food (31) to its children. So, each child ant at level 2 (4 and 6) will have a total of 10 food distributed to them (due to division and distribution from above), which sums to 10 resulting in 10 food at the next level. - At level 3, following the food distribution rule, the children at level 2 divide and distribute their food to their respective children: 10 food is divided amongst 3, 1, 5, and 2 leading to a level 3 distribution sum of 7.

He has a collection of integers which he wants to insert into an initially empty binary search tree (BST). After building the tree by inserting all integers from his collection (in the given order), he\'s interested in computing the height of the tree. The height of a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf. An empty tree has height -1, and a tree with just one node has height 0. Given a list of integers, write a program to compute the height of the BST formed by inserting these integers in the given order. Henry may want to test this on multiple lists of integers. Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The next t lines each contain: - an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of integers in the current list, - followed by n space-separated integers representing the list of integers. Output Output t integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the height of the BST formed by the list of integers given in the i-th test case.

They want to implement a new feature that determines the total rental cost for a customer based on the rental periods provided. Each rental period is given as a pair of integers, start and end, representing the hour at which the rental starts and ends, respectively. Both start and end are in 24-hour format (e.g., 13 for 1 PM). The rental cost is calculated as follows: - If the rental period is within the company\'s working hours (from 9 to 17 inclusive), the rate is 15 per hour. - If the rental period falls outside of working hours, the rate is 20 per hour. Your task is to write a program that calculates the total rental cost for each provided rental period. Input: The first line contains an integer t, the number of rental periods. Each of the next t lines contains two integers, start and end, representing the start and end hours of the rental period. Output: For each rental period, print the total rental cost.

Thus, total cost = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50. Consider the second test case: - The rental period from 10 to 14 is entirely within working hours. Thus, total cost = 15 * (14 - 10) = 60. Consider the third test case: - The rental period from 16 to 18 includes one hour within working hours, 16 to 17, at the rate of 15, plus one hour outside working hours, 17 to 18, at the rate of 20. Thus, total cost = 15 + 20 = 35. Consider the fourth test case: - The rental period from 22 to 2 spans over midnight: From 22 to 23 and from 0 to 2 are considered outside working hours.

She needs to encode some text messages into integer sequences and then decode them back into their original form. Lisa has devised a simple encoding scheme: each character in a message is to be converted to its ASCII value, and these values are stored in a list. However, Lisa is worried that her decoding might go wrong if the list of ASCII values is not correctly formed. You need to write a function to help Lisa verify whether a given list of integers could be a result of encoding a valid text message.
