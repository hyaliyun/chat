Each thread runs in the context of a process and shares the same data space. Parallelism, on the other hand, is a type of concurrency where tasks are truly executed simultaneously, typically on multiple cores/CPUs. It focuses on improving the throughput and performance by executing multiple computations at the same time. Key Differences: - Concurrency is about dealing with lots of tasks at once but not necessarily doing them simultaneously. - Parallelism is about doing lots of tasks simultaneously, leveraging multiple cores/processors. In modern high-level programming languages like Python, concurrency can be achieved through various models such as threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming. Example of concurrency using threading in Python: import threading import time def worker(delay, name): Worker function to simulate a task with a delay print(f\\"Thread {name} starting\\") time.sleep(delay) print(f\\"Thread {name} finished after {delay} seconds\\") # Creating threads thread1 = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(2, \'A\')) thread2 = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(3, \'B\')) # Starting threads thread1.start() thread2.start() # Waiting for all threads to complete thread1.join() thread2.join() print(\\"All threads have finished\\") Best Practices: 1. Ensure thread safety when threads share resources (use locks, semaphores). 2. Limit the number of active threads to avoid overwhelming the system. 3. Handle exceptions in threads to prevent silent failures. Potential Pitfalls: 1. Race Conditions - Threads attempting to modify shared resources simultaneously. 2. Deadlocks - Two or more threads waiting forever for resources held by each other. 3. Starvation - A thread might not get enough CPU time if other threads monopolize the resources."},{"question":"You are given a string containing lowercase letters and an integer `k`.

The function should have an initial balance and support the following operations: \\"deposit\\", \\"withdraw\\", \\"check_balance\\", \\"transfer\\", \\"apply_interest\\", \\"calculate_loan_emi\\", \\"view_transaction_history\\". The function will receive a list of operations and their associated amounts, if applicable.

Here are the detailed operations: 1. \\"deposit\\": Increments the balance by the given amount. 2. \\"withdraw\\": Decrements the balance by the given amount, only if sufficient balance is available. 3. \\"check_balance\\": Returns the current balance. 4. \\"transfer\\": Transfers the given amount to another account, only if sufficient balance is available. For simplicity, assume the operation always succeeds, and only deduct the amount from the current balance. 5. \\"apply_interest\\": Applies a predefined interest rate (say 3% per annum) to the current balance. 6. \\"calculate_loan_emi\\": Calculates the monthly Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) of a loan. The function should receive the loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan tenure (in years) and return the EMI amount. 7. \\"view_transaction_history\\": Returns a list of all the previous transactions made (including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers) in the order they were performed.

Additionally, the function should compute the average value of the elements in the new list and return it along with the new list. For example, given the list `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and the threshold `25`, the function should return the new list `[30, 40, 50]` and the average value `40.0`. ```python def filter_and_average(numbers, threshold): # Your code here # Example input numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] threshold = 25 # Expected output # New list: [30, 40, 50] # Average value: 40.0 ```","solution":"def filter_and_average(numbers, threshold): Filters the elements in the list greater than the threshold and computes their average.

The task involves calculating how much rainwater is able to be trapped between the buildings after it rains. The heights are given as a non-negative integer array `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of the i-th building. The goal is to determine the maximum volume of water that can be trapped between the buildings post-rainfall. For example, consider the following scenarios: Example 1: Input: heights = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] Output: 6 Explanation: After raining, water is trapped between the buildings such that the water levels are as follows: [ ____ _| |_ |1|| ||_ |____||_| ] Thus, the total trapped water is 6 units. Example 2: Input: heights = [4,2,0,3,2,5] Output: 9 Explanation: After raining, water is trapped between the buildings such that the water levels are as follows: [ _|______ |4|| | _ |___| || | |_| |_____| ] Thus, the total trapped water is 9 units. Please note: The height of each building will be within the range [0, 10000]. The length of the `heights` list is within the range [1, 100000].","solution":"def trap_rainwater(heights): Calculate the maximum volume of water that can be trapped between buildings after it rains.

Each transaction in the file is recorded as a single line, following the format: ``` [TRANSACTION_ID], [FROM_ACCOUNT], [TO_ACCOUNT], [AMOUNT] ``` For example: ``` 123456, 1001, 2002, 500.00 123457, 1003, 2004, 1500.00 123458, 1001, 1001, 1000.00 ``` Your goal is to identify any transactions where the `FROM_ACCOUNT` and `TO_ACCOUNT` are the same, as these might indicate potential fraud. Additionally, you need to flag any transactions where the `AMOUNT` exceeds 1000.00, which may require further review. Write a Python function `analyze_transactions(file_path)` that reads the transactions from the provided file, identifies suspicious transactions based on the given criteria, and returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should contain the `TRANSACTION_ID` and a `reason` for being flagged, such as `[\\"same_account\\", \\"high_amount\\"]`. Example usage: ```python result = analyze_transactions(\\"transactions.txt\\") print(result) ``` Expected output for the given example should be: ```python [ {\\"TRANSACTION_ID\\": \\"123458\\", \\"reason\\": [\\"same_account\\", \\"high_amount\\"]}, {\\"TRANSACTION_ID\\": \\"123457\\", \\"reason\\": [\\"high_amount\\"]} ] ``` Note: - The function should handle any errors, such as missing or malformed data, gracefully. - Ensure that the file is properly closed after reading.","solution":"def analyze_transactions(file_path): suspicious_transactions = [] try: with open(file_path, \\"r\\") as file: lines = file.readlines() for line in lines: try: transaction_id, from_account, to_account, amount = line.strip().split(\\", \\") reasons = [] # Check if FROM_ACCOUNT and TO_ACCOUNT are the same if from_account == to_account: reasons.append(\\"same_account\\") # Check if AMOUNT exceeds 1000.00 if float(amount) > 1000.00: reasons.append(\\"high_amount\\") if reasons: suspicious_transactions.append({ \\"TRANSACTION_ID\\": transaction_id, \\"reason\\": reasons }) except ValueError: # Handle missing or malformed data continue except FileNotFoundError: # Handle file not found error print(f\\"File {file_path} not found.\\") return suspicious_transactions"}]'),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},O={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],L={key:0},D={key:1};function j(i,e,l,m,s,a){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),r("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",S,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),_(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>s.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,s.searchQuery]]),s.searchQuery?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>s.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(n(!0),r(b,null,w(a.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(p,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),a.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),r("div",O,' No results found for "'+d(s.searchQuery)+'".
