Your task is to create a simulation to observe how the water levels in these sources change over the given period based on the daily operations. Each day, for q days, one of the following will happen: 1. A certain amount of water from a given source will be utilized, reducing its current water level. 2. A certain amount of water will be added to a given source, increasing its current water level. 3.

She plans to capture photos of various animals at different locations in the forest. However, each location in the forest can be visited only once and certain locations have restrictions based on the time she visits them. Each location has a start time s, an end time e, and a value v that represents the potential value of capturing a photo at that location. Diane can visit a location from time s until time e-1 (i.e., the visit ends just before time e). Help Diane determine the maximum possible value she can obtain from the locations she visits. The challenge is that at any point in time, only one location can be visited. Input The first line of input contains a single integer indicating the number of test cases T ≤ 50. Each test case begins with two integers n and m with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 50. This means there are n locations to consider and the time period available is from time 0 to time m. Each of the following n lines describes a location and consists of three integers s, e, and v. The numbers satisfy 0 ≤ s < e ≤ m and 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000. This means that the location is available to visit during time units s, s+1, ..., e-1 and will yield a value of v if Diane visits it. Test cases are separated by a single blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.

Define s_i = sumlimits_{j=l_i}^{r_i} {a_j} to be the sum of the elements in segment [l_i, r_i]. Minimize the maximum value of maxlimits_{1 leq i leq k} s_i - minlimits_{1 leq i leq k} s_i. You must return the minimized value as the output. -----Input----- The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 leq k leq n leq 200,000) — the size of the given array and the number of segments in a partition.

She wants her students to learn about finding subsequences that meet certain criteria. She presents them with the following problem: Given an array of positive integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) such that the sum of the elements in this subsequence is a prime number. An increasing subsequence is a subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one. A subsequence is formed by deleting any number of elements (including zero) from the array, keeping the remaining elements in their original order.

He loves to generate sequences based on simple mathematical rules. Recently, he has come up with a new sequence which he calls the \\"Incremental Sum Sequence\\". The sequence is formed by taking the sum of elements of an initial array and appending it to the original array, repeatedly. Here\'s the detailed process for generating the sequence: 1. Start with an initial array of `n` non-negative integers. 2. Calculate the sum of the current array. 3. Append this sum to the end of the current array. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a total of `m` times.

He needs your help to determine if this transformation is possible, and if so, output the minimum number of operations needed.

As a contestant, you\'ve made it to the final round where the challenge is to solve a puzzle involving strings and integer sequences. The task is straightforward yet tricky: given a string comprised of lowercase English letters, you need to transform it into a sequence of integers, where each character is mapped to a unique integer in a way that maintains the order and groups of identical characters. Here are the rules for transformation: 1. Each unique character in the string is assigned a unique integer starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new character that appears in the order of their first occurrence. 2. The same characters receive the same integer throughout the string. For example, given the string \'abacabad\', the transformation would follow this scheme: - \'a\' is the first unique character and is assigned 1. - \'b\' is the second unique character and is assigned 2. - The next \'a\' has already been assigned 1, so it remains 1. - \'c\' is a new character and is assigned 3. - The next \'a\' has already been assigned 1, so it remains 1. - The next \'b\' has already been assigned 2, so it remains 2. - The last \'a\' has already been assigned 1, so it remains 1. - \'d\' is a new character and is assigned 4.

The city\'s goal is to minimize the number of intersections required to keep all routes connected while ensuring there are no cycles. John, the city\'s transportation planner, must ensure that all routes remain accessible with the minimum number of intersections. Given n routes and m possible intersections, each described by two space-separated integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi), determine the minimum number of intersections required to make all bus routes connected and the list of intersections to achieve this.

One day, she decided to create a challenge that involves encoding strings in a specific format. Given a string, your task is to create a compressed version of the string using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). RLE is a simple form of lossless data compression where sequences of the same data value (characters in this case) are stored as a single data value and count. For instance, the string \\"aaabbccc\\" would be encoded as \\"a3b2c3\\". To further specify: - The encoded format should maintain the order of characters. - Each group of the same character is represented by the character followed by the number of repetitions. You need to implement the function `encode_string` which takes a string `s` and returns the RLE compressed version of the string. Function Signature ```python def encode_string(s: str) -> str: pass ``` **Input:** - `s`: a string (1 ≤ len(s) ≤ 10^6), consisting of only lowercase English letters. **Output:** - A string representing the RLE compressed version of the input. Example input #00 ``` aaabbccc ``` Example output #00 ``` a3b2c3 ``` Example input #01 ``` aabb ``` Example output #01 ``` a2b2 ``` Example input #02 ``` abcd ``` Example output #02 ``` a1b1c1d1 ``` **Explanation of Example Outputs:** - In the first example, the character \'a\' appears 3 times consecutively, \'b\' appears 2 times, and \'c\' appears 3 times. - In the second example, \'a\' and \'b\' each appear consecutively 2 times. - In the third example, every character in the string appears only once, hence all counts are 1.","solution":"def encode_string(s: str) -> str: Encodes the string using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

You are given a number of ports and defined cargo routes between them. You are also given a list of required cargo shipments between specific ports. Your task is to check whether all the required shipments can be fulfilled using the existing routes, and if they can, list the directions of the routes.

Ports are numbered 1 through n. Each of the following m lines contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 leq x_i < y_i leq n), indicating the i-th route connects ports x_i and y_i. At most one route exists between any two ports. It is guaranteed that any two ports are connected through one or more routes.

Here are the specifics: - Each individual movie ticket is sold for a specific price, provided via the input. - A discount bundle consists of exactly three movies and is sold for a fixed price. If the three most expensive, available individual movie tickets in the selection sum up to more than the bundle price, the platform will profit more by selling them as individual tickets rather than as a bundle.
