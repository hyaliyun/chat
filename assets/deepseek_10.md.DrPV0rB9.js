Each truck at a depot has a maximum load capacity it can carry, and each route requires a specific amount of fuel that depends on the weight of the cargo and the distance to be traveled. Given multiple depots, each with a fleet of trucks, you need to determine the minimum fuel required for each depot to deliver all the cargo it needs to dispatch. Assume that a truck can only take one trip to deliver its cargo. ----Input---- The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case: - The first line contains three integers N, D, and F where `N` is the number of trucks in the depot, `D` is the distance to be traveled, and `F` is the fuel efficiency in liters per unit weight per unit distance for all trucks. - The following N lines each contain two integers `capacity_i` and `cargo_i` denoting the maximum load capacity of the `i-th` truck and the weight of the cargo assigned to the `i-th` truck. ----Output---- For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum fuel required for the depot to dispatch all its trucks.

So, the total minimum fuel required for the first depot is `450000 + 500000 + 300000 = 1250000` liters.

For each log entry, extract and process the `timestamp`, `service_name`, and `latency`. 3. Compute the total latency for each service. 4. Identify the service with the highest individual latency. 5. Output the total latencies of all distinct services. 6. Output the service name with the highest individual latency entry. The input is a sequence of lines. Each line represents a log entry with the format: `timestamp service_name latency`. The last line contains the word `end`, which marks the end of the input. # Input ``` 15:32:10 serviceA 120 15:32:15 serviceB 80 15:32:20 serviceA 150 15:32:30 serviceC 200 15:32:35 serviceB 50 15:32:40 serviceC 100 15:32:45 serviceA 250 end ``` # Output ``` serviceA: 520 serviceB: 130 serviceC: 300 Highest Latency: serviceA ``` **Note:** In the input example above, `serviceA`, `serviceB`, and `serviceC` each have multiple log entries. The total latency for each service is the sum of all latencies recorded for that service. `serviceA` has the highest individual latency of `250` ms. Hence, the output displays the calculated total latency for each service and the service (`serviceA`) which had the highest single latency entry.","solution":"def process_logs(log_entries): Processes log entries to compute total latencies and the highest single latency.

However, with every destination drop-off, the ship can pick up additional packages from a specific drop-off location. The company wants to optimize the routes taken by the ship so that it can carry the maximum number of packages without exceeding its maximum load at any point in time. The destinations must be visited in the given order. Given: - An array `w` where `w[i]` represents the weight of the packages to be delivered at destination `i`. - An array `p` where `p[i]` represents the weight of the packages picked up at destination `i`. - A single integer `m`, representing the maximum load capacity of the ship.

The objective is to maximize the number of different projects that can be set up given these constraints, while also making sure that no two identical projects are displayed more than once.

Each order name was represented as a string of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Two orders were considered similar if they were anagrams of each other (i.e., one order name could be rearranged to form the other). The king wanted to group all similar orders together. Write a function `group_orders` that takes a list of order names and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains orders that are anagrams of each other. The order of the output groups and the order of the strings within each group do not matter. For example: ```python group_orders([\\"duel\\", \\"dule\\", \\"speed\\", \\"spede\\", \\"deul\\", \\"cars\\"]) # returns [[\\"duel\\", \\"dule\\", \\"deul\\"], [\\"speed\\", \\"spede\\"], [\\"cars\\"]] group_orders([\\"listen\\", \\"silent\\", \\"enlist\\", \\"google\\", \\"gogole\\", \\"inlets\\"]) # returns [[\\"listen\\", \\"silent\\", \\"enlist\\", \\"inlets\\"], [\\"google\\", \\"gogole\\"]] ``` For simplicity, you can assume that there will be no duplicate orders in the input list. To solve this problem, consider the following steps: 1. Create a helper function `is_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool` that checks whether two strings are anagrams. 2. Iterate through the list of orders and use the helper function to group anagrams. 3. Return the groups of anagrams as a list of lists. **Note**: Efficiency can be improved by sorting the characters of each string and using a dictionary to group anagrams.","solution":"from collections import defaultdict def group_orders(order_names): Groups the order names into lists of anagrams. :param order_names: List of order names (strings) :return: List of lists containing grouped anagrams anagram_groups = defaultdict(list) for order in order_names: sorted_order = \'\'.join(sorted(order)) anagram_groups[sorted_order].append(order) return list(anagram_groups.values())"},{"question":"You are given an array of n integers A = [a_1, a_2, dots, a_n] and another integer k.

A_N ``` - The first line contains a single integer N (1 leq N leq 100,000), the number of trees in the forest. - The second line contains N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (0 leq A_i leq 10^9), representing the affinity rating of each tree. # Output Output a single integer representing the highest affinity value of any tree that can be achieved by performing the joining operations optimally. # Example Input ``` 5 5 7 12 8 3 ``` Output ``` 7 ``` Explanation: One optimal way to achieve the highest affinity is to join trees with ratings 7 (0b0111) and 12 (0b1100). The bitwise AND operation results in 4 (0b0100). However, joining trees with ratings 7 (0b0111) and 5 (0b0101) results in 5, which is the highest possible resulting affinity. # Note - Consider the properties of the bitwise AND operation to determine the optimal strategy for joining the trees. - Efficient algorithms might involve data structures or bit manipulation techniques to solve the problem within the given constraints.","solution":"def max_affinity_value(n, affinities): Returns the maximum affinity value of any tree after performing the joining operations optimally. max_affinity = 0 for affinity in affinities: max_affinity |= affinity # Using bitwise OR return max_affinity"},{"question":"The company \\"Wood Wonders\\" produces handmade wooden sculptures, each with a unique serial number.

They have a network of delivery points represented as an undirected weighted graph. A delivery point can be a warehouse or a customer location. The company wants to ensure that every customer location is reachable from at least one warehouse and vice versa. To enhance the efficiency of their system, they need to evaluate the minimum cost required to achieve this. The task is to help the company find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) cost for the network. The nodes of the graph are labeled from 1 to n, where each node either represents a warehouse or a customer location. An undirected weighted edge represents a road with a given cost connecting two nodes. Specifically, your task is to find the MST for this graph, ensuring the connectivity conditions mentioned, and return its cost.

The directory tree expands from a root directory and can have nested subdirectories and files. Your program will receive commands to either navigate through this directory tree or to list files and directories at a specific level. Operations to be handled are: - `cd <directory_name>`: Navigate into the given directory. - `cd ..`: Navigate to the parent directory. - `ls`: List all items in the current directory. Assume: - The root directory is named `root`. - Directory and file names are unique within the same directory. - The initial state when the program starts is the root directory. - Directories and their structures are predefined and provided as input. Your task is to write a program that takes these commands and provides the required output for each `ls` command. Input: - The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) which denotes the number of directories and files. - The next `n` lines describe the directory structure. Each line contains a path to either a file or a directory. Paths use a slash `/` as the separator, starting from the root. - The next line contains an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), which represents the number of commands. - The following `m` lines contain commands (`cd <directory_name>`, `cd ..`, or `ls`). Output: - For each `ls` command, output the items (directories and files) in the current directory, one directory/file per line, in lexicographical order. If there are multiple `ls` commands, separate the outputs for different commands with a blank line.

Each squad member is assigned a certain sector, and they report to the Squad Leader. If sector S has the facility F with certain protection level, then all members will follow the command from S to protect F with the given collaboration percentage of protection. Each facility is being monitored by multiple sectors, and each team provides different levels of security which sums up to the total security level of the facility. You have to design a structure for assigning protection levels and provide results for certain queries when commanded by the Squad Leader. Given a forest with N sectors numbered from 1 to N (with 1 being the Squad Leader\'s sector) and M queries to either update protection levels or to report total security level for a facility. Each sector i is initially assigned a protection level based on the provided data. The queries can be of the type: - \\"P S F\\" - Calculate and report the total protection level for the facility F provided by all sectors that report to sector S, including S itself. - \\"U S x\\" - Update the protection level of sector S to the value x. Input Format: - The first line will contain integers N and M, representing the number of sectors and the number of queries. - The second line will contain N nonnegative integers, each representing the initial protection levels of the N sectors. - The following N-1 lines will contain pairs of integers (u, v), signifying the reporting structure (either u reports to v or vice-versa). - The next M lines will contain a query in one of the two formats \\"P S F\\" or \\"U S x\\".
