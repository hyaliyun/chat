Each player can participate in multiple rounds of the game, and their final score is determined by the sum of points earned in each round. However, to offset the scoring system and give some players a better chance, David decided to subtract the lowest score attained in any round from the total score of the player. David needs your help to automate the calculation of the scores. Given the scores of each player in every round they participated in, you need to determine their final adjusted score. A player\'s adjusted score is calculated by summing up all their scores and then subtracting their lowest score. If a player has only participated in one round, their adjusted score is simply zero. -----Input----- The first line contains an integer p (1 le p le 100) — the number of players. The following p lines describe the scores of each player. Each line starts with an integer r_i (1 le r_i le 50) — the number of rounds the i-th player participated in. This is followed by r_i integers s_{ij} (0 le s_{ij} le 100) — the scores of the i-th player in each of the r_i rounds. -----Output----- Print p lines, each line containing one integer — the final adjusted score of the i-th player. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 10 20 30 40 50 2 5 15 1 100 Output 140 15 0 Input 2 3 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 Output 5 24 -----Note----- In the first example, for the first player, the sum of scores is 10+20+30+40+50 = 150, and the lowest score is 10. Thus, the final adjusted score is 150 - 10 = 140. For the second player, the sum of scores is 5 + 15 = 20, and the lowest score is 5. Thus, the final adjusted score is 20 - 5 = 15. For the third player, since they only participated in one round, their final adjusted score is 0. In the second example, the first player has scores 1, 2, 3, with sum 6 and lowest score 1, thus adjusted score is 5.

The field is represented as a two-dimensional grid consisting of `r` rows and `c` columns. Each cell in the grid may contain an empty space, an asteroid, or the spaceship (your position). The grid is represented using the following symbols: - `.`: an empty space where the spaceship can move; - `#`: an asteroid where the spaceship cannot move; - `S`: the starting position of the spaceship. There will be exactly one occurrence of this in the grid; - `E`: the exit position that you need to reach. There will be exactly one occurrence of this in the grid. The spaceship can move in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Moving from one cell to another adjacent cell takes 1 unit of time. However, the asteroid field is unstable, and after every `m` units of time, the grid reconfigures itself. When it reconfigures, the positions of all asteroids (`#` cells) change positions according to predefined transformation rules. You will be provided with a transformation grid that explains how the cells in the asteroid grid are transformed after each reconfiguration. The transformation grid consists of `r` rows and `c` columns and contains one of the following symbols for each cell: - `U`: The cell above the current cell in the asteroid grid should be moved to this cell (if the cell is on the topmost row, the asteroid wraps around to the bottom row); - `D`: The cell below the current cell in the asteroid grid should be moved to this cell (if the cell is in the bottommost row, the asteroid wraps around to the top row); - `L`: The cell to the left of the current cell in the asteroid grid should be moved to this cell (if the cell is on the leftmost column, the asteroid wraps around to the right column); - `R`: The cell to the right of the current cell in the asteroid grid should be moved to this cell (if the cell is on the rightmost column, the asteroid wraps around to the left column). Write a program that finds the minimum time required for the spaceship to reach the exit position, considering the asteroid reconfigurations. # Input The first line of input contains three integers `r`, `c`, and `m` (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid and the time interval after which the grid reconfigures, respectively. The next `r` lines contain `c` characters each, representing the initial configuration of the asteroid field, where each character is one of `.`, `#`, `S`, or `E`. The following `r` lines contain `c` characters each, representing the transformation grid, where each character is one of `U`, `D`, `L`, or `R`. # Output Output a single line with the minimum time required to reach the exit position. If it is impossible to reach the exit, output -1. # Example Input ``` 4 4 2 S..# .... .#.. ..E# DUDU RLUD LRLU UDUD ``` Output ``` 5 ``` Explanation 1. The spaceship starts at the top left corner (position `(0, 0)`) and moves right two steps: `S -> . -> ..`. 2. After two steps, the grid reconfigures according to the transformation rules described in the transformation grid. 3. The spaceship then moves down two steps and right one step, reaching the exit (position `(2, 3)`). Note: wrapping behavior needs to be accounted for during the transformation.","solution":"from collections import deque def transform_grid(current_grid, r, c, transformations): new_grid = [[\'.\'] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(r): for j in range(c): if current_grid[i][j] == \'#\': if transformations[i][j] == \'U\': new_grid[(i - 1 + r) % r][j] = \'#\' elif transformations[i][j] == \'D\': new_grid[(i + 1) % r][j] = \'#\' elif transformations[i][j] == \'L\': new_grid[i][(j - 1 + c) % c] = \'#\' elif transformations[i][j] == \'R\': new_grid[i][(j + 1) % c] = \'#\' return new_grid def minimum_time_to_exit(r, c, m, grid, transformations): start, end = None, None for i in range(r): for j in range(c): if grid[i][j] == \'S\': start = (i, j) if grid[i][j] == \'E\': end = (i, j) if not start or not end: return -1 queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)]) visited = set([(start[0], start[1], 0)]) directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] while queue: x, y, time = queue.popleft() current_grid = grid if time > 0 and time % m == 0: current_grid = transform_grid(grid, r, c, transformations) if (x, y) == end: return time for dx, dy in directions: nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy if 0 <= nx < r and 0 <= ny < c and current_grid[nx][ny] != \'#\' and (nx, ny, (time + 1) % m) not in visited: queue.append((nx, ny, time + 1)) visited.add((nx, ny, (time + 1) % m)) return -1"},{"question":"You are given a network of computers connected by various bidirectional cables.

Given the heights of all floors for a specific building, you need to determine the average floor height for a set number of queries. Each query consists of a range of floors, and you must calculate the average height of floors within that range (inclusive). Input The first line contains two integers N and Q, where N is the number of floors in the building, and Q is the number of queries. The second line contains N non-negative integers representing the height of each floor in the building. Heights are given from the 1st floor to the Nth floor. The following Q lines each contain two integers L and R which describe a query. For each query, determine the average height of floors from the L-th to the R-th (inclusive).

Chef Ciel needs to find out the minimum number of alert towers required to ensure that every affected house is covered by at least one alert tower. An alert tower can be placed at any house (regardless of whether it has a monster or not) and it will alert all monsters within a certain range `R`.

They are given an initial sequence of real numbers S[0], S[1], ..., S[n-1]. Their goal is to flip a coin n times consecutively. If the coin lands heads, they increment the current index by 1 (i.e., move to the next element in the array); if it lands tails, they decrement the current index by 1 (i.e., move to the previous element in the array). Starting from index 0, they want to compute the expected sum of the sequence values encountered during these flips. Mark\'s objective is to maximize the sum, while Nancy\'s objective is to minimize it. However, they don\'t know the outcomes of the coin flips in advance and thus have to work with the expected value.

However, over n=3 steps, there is an equal probability to move back and forth around the indices, such that all indices and their values are equally probable after n flips.

Each query contains a vertex v and the program should output how many nodes in the subtree of v have a different parent from v. **Input:** - The first line contains a single integer n (1 leq n leq 2 cdot 10^5), the number of vertices in the tree. - The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, indicating an edge between vertices u and v. - The next line contains a single integer q (1 leq q leq 2 cdot 10^5), the number of queries. - The following q lines each contain a single integer v_i (2 leq v_i leq n), indicating a query for vertex v_i. **Output:** - For each query, output a single integer: the number of nodes in the subtree of v_i that have a different parent from v_i. **Example input:** ``` 7 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7 3 2 3 4 ``` **Example output:** ``` 2 2 0 ``` **Explanation:** - For query 2: the subtree of vertex 2 includes nodes {2, 4, 5}. Both nodes 4 and 5 have different parents from vertex 2. Thus the output is 2 for this query. - For query 3: the subtree of vertex 3 includes nodes {3, 6, 7}. Both nodes 6 and 7 have different parents from vertex 3. Thus the output is 2 for this query. - For query 4: the subtree of vertex 4 includes only the node 4, which has no other descendants, hence 0.","solution":"def count_different_parent_nodes(n, edges, queries): from collections import defaultdict, deque # Build the tree as an adjacency list tree = defaultdict(list) for u, v in edges: tree[u].append(v) tree[v].append(u) # Compute the parent and size of subtree for each vertex parent = {1: None} subtree_size = {} def dfs(node): subtree_size[node] = 1 for neighbor in tree[node]: if neighbor not in parent: parent[neighbor] = node dfs(neighbor) subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[neighbor] dfs(1) # Process each query and calculate the number of nodes with different parent result = [] for v in queries: result.append(subtree_size[v] - 1) return result"},{"question":"A magical kingdom has a network of cities connected by one-way roads.

Each cell on the grid is designated by its coordinates (i, j), where i is the row number (0-indexed from the top) and j is the column number (0-indexed from the left). There are N robots positioned on the grid. The position of the i-th robot is (R_i, C_i). Each robot can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. A robot can move exactly one cell in any of these directions in one step. The relay race requires robots to pass a baton from one to another. The baton starts with the first robot at (R_0, C_0). The baton needs to be passed to the last robot at (R_{N-1}, C_{N-1}). The baton must be passed directly from one robot to another by moving it to a cell adjacent to the recipient robot (sharing an edge). The cost to pass the baton from the i-th robot to the j-th robot is defined as the Manhattan distance between (R_i, C_i) and (R_j, C_j), which is |R_i - R_j| + |C_i - C_j|.

The system should support the following operations: 1. **Create a directory**: Given a directory path, create a new directory with the specified name.
