If an employee takes a leave on a working day, they are marked as absent (denoted by 0), otherwise, they are marked as present (denoted by 1). The company allows replacing up to M hours in total per week using leave hours to meet the N hours requirement. If after using the leave hours, the employee\'s working hours are still less than N hours, the additional hours they need to work is calculated. Write a program that will determine the additional hours an employee needs to work for each week given the employee’s weekly log of their working hours. The log consists of a string of N length where each character is a digit from 0 to 9 representing the hours worked each day. -----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: The first line contains two integers, N and M. The second line contains a string of N length representing the working hours log. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer denoting the additional hours the employee needs to work to meet the N hours requirement. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 - 0 ≤ M ≤ 10 - Each character in the string is a digit from 0 to 9 -----Example----- Input 3 7 2 5123456 5 1 00001 8 4 22222222 Output 0 1 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The employee has worked a total of 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 26 hours without any leave needed.

Even after using the maximum leave allowed, they have 1 + 1 = 2 hours, which is still less than 5. They need 5 - 2 = 3 additional hours to meet the weekly requirement, but as they need one extra leave hour. Example case 3: The employee has worked a total of 2*8 = 16 hours without any leave needed.

This time, it involves arrays and numbers. You are given an array `A` of `n` integers. For each prefix `A[1], A[2], ..., A[i]` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in the prefix equal to its median. An operation consists of incrementing or decrementing an element by 1. The median of a list of numbers is the middle element when they are sorted. If there are an even number of elements, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements. -----Input:----- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Each project requires certain amounts of CPU cores and memory to run. You have a pool of servers, each with a specific number of CPU cores and a specified amount of memory. Your task is to assign projects to servers such that all project requirements are met without exceeding the server\'s resources. Visual Representation Imagine this simple version: - Servers and projects are represented as lists of dictionaries. - Each dictionary has `cpu` and `memory` keys indicating the resource available on a server or required by a project. Example Servers: ```python servers = [ {\\"cpu\\": 8, \\"memory\\": 32}, {\\"cpu\\": 16, \\"memory\\": 64}, {\\"cpu\\": 4, \\"memory\\": 16}, ] ``` Projects: ```python projects = [ {\\"cpu\\": 2, \\"memory\\": 8}, {\\"cpu\\": 4, \\"memory\\": 16}, {\\"cpu\\": 10, \\"memory\\": 32}, ] ``` One possible assignment: ```python [ {\\"server\\": 0, \\"project\\": 0}, # Project 0 assigned to Server 0 {\\"server\\": 0, \\"project\\": 1}, # Project 1 assigned to Server 0 {\\"server\\": 1, \\"project\\": 2}, # Project 2 assigned to Server 1 ] ``` Kata Task Write a function `assign_projects_to_servers(servers, projects)` that takes two lists as arguments: - A list of servers, each represented by a dictionary with `cpu` and `memory`. - A list of projects, each represented by a dictionary with `cpu` and `memory`. The function should return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has: - a `server` key indicating the index of the server in the original list. - a `project` key indicating the index of the project in the original list. The goal is to assign each project to a server such that no server\'s CPU or memory resources are exceeded. Constraints - If a project cannot be assigned to any server, the function should raise a `ValueError` with the message \\"Insufficient resources for projects\\". - Assume all inputs are non-negative integers. - There can be multiple valid assignments. Returning any one of them is acceptable.

If the servers or projects are such that the assignment is not possible, the function should raise the `ValueError`.

For this task, you will use a set of dominoes to encode and decode messages. A standard set of dominoes includes 28 tiles, each representing a pair of numbers between 0 and 6. For example, a domino tile might represent the pair (0,0), (3,5), or (6,6). Each tile has a unique combination—there are no duplicates. Your goal is to encode a message as a unique sequence of domino tiles and decode it. Correspondence between message and permutation # Message To compose our message, we will use an alphabet containing 36 characters: the digits from 0 to 9 and the letters from A to Z. We give them the following values: ``` \\"0\\" = 0, \\"1\\" = 1, ..., \\"9\\" = 9, \\"A\\" = 10, ..., \\"Z\\" = 35 ``` This gives us a numeral system with a base equal to 36. We can compute a numeric value corresponding to any message: ``` \\"A9\\" = 369 \\"HELLO\\" = 104832177617 ``` # Permutation Given the 28 unique domino tiles, we can assign a unique number to each of the possible permutations of the set. To attribute a unique number to each permutation, we will use the lexicographical order. For example, with domino tiles (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1): ``` (0,0)(0,1)(1,1) = 0 (0,0)(1,1)(0,1) = 1 ... ``` For a set of 28 domino tiles, there are `28!` (factorial of 28) possible permutations. We can convert the numeric value of a message to one of these permutations, thus encoding the message in the order of dominoes. You will write two functions: * `encode(message)`: This function takes a message as input and returns a list of tuples representing domino tiles ordered to hide the message. Return `None` if the message contains invalid characters or has a numeric value greater than or equal to `28!`. * `decode(dominoes)`: This function takes a list of tuples representing a sequence of domino tiles and returns the hidden message. Return `None` if the list of dominoes contains invalid tiles, duplicates, or doesn\'t contain exactly 28 tiles. Each tile is represented as a tuple of two integers `(a, b)` such that `0 <= a <= b <= 6`. # Examples Encoding ```python encode(\\"HELLO\\") ``` Should return: ```python [(0, 0), (0, 1), ..., (6, 6)] ``` (This is a placeholder.

The input list for decoding should contain exactly 28 tuple elements each representing a unique domino tile (from (0,0) to (6,6)).

Write a program that takes as input the string `s` and outputs the minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into a palindrome. ---Input--- The input consists of a single line containing the string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100,000) consisting of lower case English letters. ---Output--- Output a single integer, the minimum number of operations required to make the string `s` a palindrome. ---Examples--- Input abca Output 1 Input race Output 2 ---Note--- In the first example, the minimum number of operations required to make `abca` a palindrome is 1. For instance, replacing the character \'b\' with \'c\' results in the palindrome `acca`. In the second example, the minimum number of operations required to make `race` a palindrome is 2. For example, replacing \'r\' with \'e\' and \'c\' with \'a\' results in the palindrome `eaae`.","solution":"def min_operations_to_palindrome(s): Returns the minimum number of operations required to convert the string `s` into a palindrome. n = len(s) count = 0 # Compare characters from start and end for i in range(n // 2): if s[i] != s[n - i - 1]: count += 1 return count"},{"question":"Jerry is trying to paint a sequence of walls, each wall having a specific height. He can only paint walls with a brush that is exactly 1 unit wide. Jerry can paint a section of a wall by spending an amount of time proportional to its height. When he paints a continuous sequence of adjacent walls, the total time is determined by the highest wall in the sequence, as he can paint a vertical strip across all the walls at once. However, he can only paint a single continuous sequence in one operation. For example, if he paints walls with heights [2, 5, 4], the time would be determined by the tallest wall (height = 5).

This language is designed to perform simple queries on a dataset of user records. The dataset contains records of user information in the form of JSON objects, each with the following fields: \\"id\\", \\"name\\", \\"age\\", and \\"location\\". Task Your task is to write a function `query` that accepts a dataset and a MiniQuery string. The MiniQuery string can perform a basic selection using a `WHERE` clause. The function should return a list of records that match the criteria specified in the query. MiniQuery supports the following syntax: 1. `SELECT * WHERE field operator value` 2. `field`: one of `id`, `name`, `age`, `location` 3. `operator`: one of `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` 4. `value`: a number (for `id` and `age`) or a string (for `name` and `location`) Examples Consider the following dataset: ```python dataset = [ {\\"id\\": 1, \\"name\\": \\"Alice\\", \\"age\\": 30, \\"location\\": \\"New York\\"}, {\\"id\\": 2, \\"name\\": \\"Bob\\", \\"age\\": 25, \\"location\\": \\"San Francisco\\"}, {\\"id\\": 3, \\"name\\": \\"Charlie\\", \\"age\\": 35, \\"location\\": \\"Los Angeles\\"}, {\\"id\\": 4, \\"name\\": \\"David\\", \\"age\\": 28, \\"location\\": \\"Seattle\\"} ] ``` Example queries and expected results: ```python query(dataset, \\"SELECT * WHERE age > 30\\") # Returns: [{\\"id\\": 3, \\"name\\": \\"Charlie\\", \\"age\\": 35, \\"location\\": \\"Los Angeles\\"}] query(dataset, \\"SELECT * WHERE location = San Francisco\\") # Returns: [{\\"id\\": 2, \\"name\\": \\"Bob\\", \\"age\\": 25, \\"location\\": \\"San Francisco\\"}] query(dataset, \\"SELECT * WHERE id != 1\\") # Returns: [ # {\\"id\\": 2, \\"name\\": \\"Bob\\", \\"age\\": 25, \\"location\\": \\"San Francisco\\"}, # {\\"id\\": 3, \\"name\\": \\"Charlie\\", \\"age\\": 35, \\"location\\": \\"Los Angeles\\"}, # {\\"id\\": 4, \\"name\\": \\"David\\", \\"age\\": 28, \\"location\\": \\"Seattle\\"} # ] query(dataset, \\"SELECT * WHERE name = Alice\\") # Returns: [{\\"id\\": 1, \\"name\\": \\"Alice\\", \\"age\\": 30, \\"location\\": \\"New York\\"}] ``` Notes - The value comparisons for `id` and `age` should be numeric. - The value comparisons for `name` and `location` should be string-based. - Assume the query string will always be valid and properly formatted.

Here is the value of each Roman numeral: * I -> 1 * V -> 5 * X -> 10 * L -> 50 * C -> 100 * D -> 500 * M -> 1000 For example, the Roman numeral \\"MCMXCIV\\" should return 1994.

The shift cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, \'A\' would be encrypted to \'B\', \'B\' to \'C\', and so on until \'Z\' would wrap around to \'A\'. Design a function that accepts a string and an integer shift, then returns the encrypted string using the shift cipher. The shift can be positive or negative, indicating the direction of the shift along the alphabet. **Example 1:** ``` Input: message = \\"HELLO\\", shift = 3 Output: \\"KHOOR\\" Explanation: Each letter in \\"HELLO\\" is shifted by 3 positions in the alphabet: H->K, E->H, L->O, L->O, O->R. ``` **Example 2:** ``` Input: message = \\"ABC\\", shift = -1 Output: \\"ZAB\\" Explanation: Each letter in \\"ABC\\" is shifted by -1 positions in the alphabet: A->Z, B->A, C->B. ``` **Example 3:** ``` Input: message = \\"PYTHON\\", shift = 26 Output: \\"PYTHON\\" Explanation: A shift of 26 results in the same message as it completes a full cycle of the alphabet. ``` **Note:** 1.

Write a function `find_shortest_path(graph, landmarks)` that takes two inputs: 1. `graph`: A dictionary where the keys are tuples representing a pair of landmarks, and the values are integers representing the lengths of the paths between those landmarks. 2. `landmarks`: A list of strings representing the names of the landmarks you need to visit. The function should return a list of landmarks starting at the initial landmark, visiting each one exactly once, and returning to the initial landmark, such that the total path length is minimized. **Example:** ```python graph = { (\'A\', \'B\'): 10, (\'A\', \'C\'): 15, (\'B\', \'C\'): 35, (\'B\', \'D\'): 25, (\'C\', \'D\'): 30 } landmarks = [\'A\', \'B\', \'C\', \'D\'] find_shortest_path(graph, landmarks) ``` **Expected Output:** The output should be a list of landmarks showing the shortest path, such as: ``` [\'A\', \'B\', \'D\', \'C\', \'A\'] ```","solution":"import itertools def calculate_path_length(graph, path): total_length = 0 for i in range(len(path) - 1): segment = (path[i], path[i + 1]) if segment in graph: total_length += graph[segment] else: total_length += graph[(path[i + 1], path[i])] # assuming the graph is undirected return total_length def find_shortest_path(graph, landmarks): shortest_path = None shortest_length = float(\'inf\') all_permutations = itertools.permutations(landmarks[1:]) for perm in all_permutations: path = [landmarks[0]] + list(perm) + [landmarks[0]] length = calculate_path_length(graph, path) if length < shortest_length: shortest_length = length shortest_path = path return shortest_path"},{"question":"# Linked List Cycle Detection Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. # Definition A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a pointer (reference) to the next node in the sequence. # Challenge Write a function `hasCycle(head)` that accepts the head node of a linked list and returns `True` if the linked list contains a cycle, or `False` otherwise. # Explanation A cycle occurs if a node’s `next` pointer points back to a previous node in the linked list, thereby forming a loop. For example, in the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2`, node `4` points back to node `2`, forming a cycle. The function needs to efficiently determine whether such a cycle exists without modifying the linked list. # Approach One common way to detect cycles in a linked list is Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the \\"tortoise and hare\\" algorithm), which uses two pointers moving at different speeds. # Example ```python class ListNode: def __init__(self, value=0, next=None): self.value = value self.next = next def hasCycle(head): tortoise, hare = head, head while hare is not None and hare.next is not None: tortoise = tortoise.next hare = hare.next.next if tortoise == hare: return True return False # Example 1: # Input: # head = ListNode(3) # second = ListNode(2) # third = ListNode(0) # fourth = ListNode(-4) # head.next = second # second.next = third # third.next = fourth # fourth.next = second # Cycle here # Output: True # Example 2: # Input: head = ListNode(1) # second = ListNode(2) # head.next = second # second.next = head # Cycle here # Output: True # Example 3: # Input: head = ListNode(1) # Output: False ```","solution":"class ListNode: def __init__(self, value=0, next=None): self.value = value self.next = next def hasCycle(head): tortoise, hare = head, head while hare is not None and hare.next is not None: tortoise = tortoise.next hare = hare.next.next if tortoise == hare: return True return False"},{"question":"Write a function that takes a string representation of a mathematical expression and evaluates it by following the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules).

Your task is to assist Merlin in determining the maximum sum he can obtain from a non-consecutive subsequence of the array. -----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 leq n leq 300,000), the number of integers in the array. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n (-10^9 leq a_i leq 10^9) — the given array. -----Output----- Output one integer, the maximum sum of a non-consecutive subsequence. -----Example----- Input 5 3 2 7 10 12 Output 22 -----Note----- In the first example, the optimal non-consecutive subsequence is [3, 7, 12] which sums up to 22. The subsequence [2, 10] also gives a sum of 12 but it is not the maximum among the possible options.","solution":"def max_non_consecutive_sum(n, arr): Returns the maximum sum of a non-consecutive subsequence in the array. if n == 0: return 0 if n == 1: return max(0, arr[0]) dp = [0] * n dp[0] = max(0, arr[0]) for i in range(1, n): dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + (dp[i-2] if i > 1 else 0)) return dp[-1]"},{"question":"You are given a binary tree with its root node. Your task is to determine the minimum depth of the tree. The minimum depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is a node with no children. Write a function `minDepth(root)` that computes the minimum depth of the binary tree. # Input - The input is a binary tree `root` represented by a TreeNode class. - The TreeNode class is given as: ```python class TreeNode: def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None): self.value = value self.left = left self.right = right ``` # Output - Return an integer representing the minimum depth of the tree. # Examples Example 1: ```python root = TreeNode(3) root.left = TreeNode(9) root.right = TreeNode(20) root.right.left = TreeNode(15) root.right.right = TreeNode(7) print(minDepth(root)) # Output: 2 ``` Example 2: ```python root = TreeNode(1) root.left = TreeNode(2) print(minDepth(root)) # Output: 2 ``` Note: - The binary tree will have at most `10^5` nodes. - Each node\'s value is an integer between `-10^5` to `10^5`. - The input will have genes with `n` nodes, where the maximum value of `n` will be `10^5`.","solution":"class TreeNode: def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None): self.value = value self.left = left self.right = right def minDepth(root): if root is None: return 0 # If left subtree is Null, check right subtree if root.left is None: return minDepth(root.right) + 1 # If right subtree is Null , check left subtree if root.right is None: return minDepth(root.left) + 1 # If none of the subtree is Null, check both subtrees return min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right)) + 1"}]'),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const r=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return r?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(r)||e.solution&&e.solution.toLowerCase().includes(r)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"search-container"},C={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],Y={key:0},z={key:1};function L(r,e,l,m,a,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",S,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>a.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[_,a.searchQuery]]),a.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>a.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",C,[(n(!0),i(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(n(),v(p,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+h(a.searchQuery)+'".
